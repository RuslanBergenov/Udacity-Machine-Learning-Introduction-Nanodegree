00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
So here's something very interesting about perceptrons and it's that

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,490
some logical operators can be represented as perceptrons.

3
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:11,250
Here, for example, we have the AND operator and how does that work?

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:15,554
The AND operator takes two inputs and it returns an output.

5
00:00:15,554 --> 00:00:18,448
The inputs can be true or false but the output is

6
00:00:18,449 --> 00:00:21,835
only true if both of the inputs are true.

7
00:00:21,835 --> 00:00:26,219
So for instance, if the inputs are true and true then the output is true.

8
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:31,065
If the inputs are true and false then the output is false.

9
00:00:31,065 --> 00:00:36,564
If the inputs are false and true then the output is false.

10
00:00:36,564 --> 00:00:42,090
And finally, if the inputs are false and false then the output is false.

11
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,134
Now, how do we turn this into a perceptron?

12
00:00:44,134 --> 00:00:48,420
Well, the first step is to turn this table of true/false into a table of zeros and

13
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:54,395
ones where the one corresponds to true and the zero corresponds to false.

14
00:00:54,395 --> 00:00:58,045
And now we draw this perceptron over here which works just as before.

15
00:00:58,045 --> 00:01:01,259
It has a line defined by weights and a bias and it has a positive area

16
00:01:01,259 --> 00:01:05,203
which is colored blue and a negative area which is colored red.

17
00:01:05,203 --> 00:01:07,184
And what this perceptron is going to do is it will

18
00:01:07,185 --> 00:01:09,129
plot each point and if the point falls in

19
00:01:09,129 --> 00:01:10,620
the positive area then it returns a

20
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,599
one and if it falls in the negative area then it returns a zero.

21
00:01:14,599 --> 00:01:17,650
So let's try it. The one one gets plotted in

22
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:21,390
the positive area so the perceptron returns a one.

23
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:27,465
The one zero gets plotted in the negative area so the perceptron returns a zero.

24
00:01:27,465 --> 00:01:34,319
The zero one gets plotted in the negative area so the perceptron returns a zero.

25
00:01:34,319 --> 00:01:37,030
And finally, the zero zero also gets plotted

26
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:41,730
in the negative area so the perceptron returns a zero.

27
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,495
Other logical operators can also be turned into perceptrons.

28
00:01:44,495 --> 00:01:46,750
For example, here is the OR operator which

29
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:50,280
returns true if any of its two inputs are true.

30
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:54,608
That gets turned to this table which gets turned into this perceptron which is very

31
00:01:54,608 --> 00:01:59,828
similar as the one before except the line has different weights and a different bias.

32
00:01:59,828 --> 00:02:03,154
What are the weights and bias for the AND and the OR perceptron?

33
00:02:03,155 --> 00:02:06,000
You'll have the chance to play with them in the quiz below.
