1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,299
Now, accuracy may not always be the best metric to use.

2
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:04,904
Let's look at this example.

3
00:00:04,905 --> 00:00:07,200
It consists of detecting credit card fraud.

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,769
So, we have a bunch of data in the form of credit card transactions,

5
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:12,879
and some of them are good like the ones in the left,

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,630
and some of them are fraudulent like the ones in the right.

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:17,160
So, let's look at numbers.

8
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:24,329
There are 284,335 good transactions and 472 fraudulent transactions.

9
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:25,829
This is actually real data.

10
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:28,349
So, let's try to come up with a model that has great accuracy.

11
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,975
So, a model that is correct most of the time.

12
00:00:30,975 --> 00:00:35,870
Can you help me think of a model that has over 99 percent accuracy?

13
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:39,429
So here's a model that has over 99 percent accuracy,

14
00:00:39,429 --> 00:00:42,575
which means it is correct over 99 percent of the time.

15
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:46,304
The model says, all the transactions are good.

16
00:00:46,304 --> 00:00:48,320
Now, what is the accuracy of this model,

17
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:51,085
namely how many times are we correct?

18
00:00:51,085 --> 00:01:00,350
Well, we're correct 284,335 times out of 284,887 times.

19
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:03,765
And that is 99.83 percent.

20
00:01:03,765 --> 00:01:06,239
So, this model must be pretty good if it's accurate is that high,

21
00:01:06,239 --> 00:01:07,829
right? Well, not really.

22
00:01:07,829 --> 00:01:10,620
This model is not catching any of the bad ones.

23
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,265
And the point of the model is to catch the fraudulent transactions.

24
00:01:14,265 --> 00:01:15,879
So let's look at another model.

25
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:18,379
Can we get a model that catches all the bad transactions?

26
00:01:18,379 --> 00:01:20,924
Can we think of one? Well, here's one,

27
00:01:20,924 --> 00:01:24,149
I'm going to label all transactions fraudulent. So, that's great, right?

28
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,090
Now, we're catching all the fraudulent transactions.

29
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:28,990
Now, is that a good model? Well, no.

30
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:32,479
That's also a terrible model since it's accidentally catching all the good ones.

31
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,109
So, it's pretty tricky, right?

32
00:01:34,109 --> 00:01:37,379
It's pretty tricky to just look at accuracy and use that to evaluate our model

33
00:01:37,379 --> 00:01:41,244
because it may completely miss the point when the data is skewed like this one.

34
00:01:41,245 --> 00:01:46,130
So, in this section, we'll study some different metrics that can catch this more easily.
