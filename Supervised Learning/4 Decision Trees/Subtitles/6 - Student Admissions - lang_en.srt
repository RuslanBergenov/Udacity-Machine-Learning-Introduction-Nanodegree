1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,679
Well, let's try both.

2
00:00:01,679 --> 00:00:05,280
The best horizontal line would be somewhere around here.

3
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:08,699
It does an okay job, but it doesn't really separate the points that well,

4
00:00:08,699 --> 00:00:11,579
at least a lot of blue points in the red area and vice versa.

5
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,650
So, what happens if we try a vertical line?

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,500
Well, it seems that the best cut is here around five.

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,629
That does a pretty good job and only leaves

8
00:00:18,629 --> 00:00:22,304
five red points on the blue side and five blue points on the red side.

9
00:00:22,304 --> 00:00:23,925
So, let's go for that one,

10
00:00:23,925 --> 00:00:26,219
and our answer is vertical line.

11
00:00:26,219 --> 00:00:30,269
This means that the best feature to separate this data is test,

12
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:32,564
and the best threshold is five.

13
00:00:32,564 --> 00:00:37,655
Therefore, we can add our first node to the decision tree and this node asks,

14
00:00:37,655 --> 00:00:41,960
"Is your test greater than or equal to five or is it less than five?"

15
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:43,880
And now, we can do even more.

16
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,570
We can try dividing each of the two halves with a horizontal line,

17
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,130
which is the equivalent of saying, "Okay.

18
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:51,455
I've seen your tests.

19
00:00:51,454 --> 00:00:53,899
Now, let's see how you did in the grades."

20
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:58,280
The left half can be cut with a vertical line over here at height seven.

21
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:02,134
This means, if your test score is less than five,

22
00:01:02,134 --> 00:01:05,365
then you need seven or more in the grades to get accepted,

23
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:07,689
otherwise, you get rejected.

24
00:01:07,689 --> 00:01:11,819
The right half can be separated with a vertical line at height two.

25
00:01:11,819 --> 00:01:15,959
This means, if your test score is greater than or equal to five,

26
00:01:15,959 --> 00:01:19,328
then you need to have two or more in your grades in order to get accepted,

27
00:01:19,328 --> 00:01:21,404
otherwise, you get rejected.

28
00:01:21,405 --> 00:01:24,195
So, we've built our Decision Tree in a similar way as before,

29
00:01:24,194 --> 00:01:25,964
except now at each node,

30
00:01:25,965 --> 00:01:27,855
we don't have a yes/no question,

31
00:01:27,855 --> 00:01:31,329
but we have a threshold which would cut the values in two.
