Congratulations. Now you have to learn how to train models, how to test them,

2
00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:06,904
how to use certain metrics to evaluate how good these models are,

3
00:00:06,905 --> 00:00:10,554
and, finally, how to tune the parameters to improve your model.

4
00:00:10,554 --> 00:00:13,199
Now you are ready to get your hands on the project where you

5
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:16,000
can put all of this knowledge in practice. Good luck.
