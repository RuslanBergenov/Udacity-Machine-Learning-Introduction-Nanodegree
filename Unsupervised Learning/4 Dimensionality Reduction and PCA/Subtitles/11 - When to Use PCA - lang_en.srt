00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,009
There are a number of different use cases for PCA.

2
00:00:08,009 --> 00:00:09,750
You work through one example,

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:14,199
where you reduce the dimensionality of image data to just over 10 features,

4
00:00:14,199 --> 00:00:19,269
while still maintaining almost the same accuracy as when all the pixels were kept.

5
00:00:19,269 --> 00:00:24,629
PCA can be used anytime you want to reduce the dimensionality of your data or find

6
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:30,614
latent features that might encapsulate a number of other features into a single factor.

7
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:35,129
Other specific situations of this include reducing the dimensionality of

8
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:38,790
high-dimensional microarray data or finding latent features

9
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:42,854
related to survey data that can help find patterns and behavioral habits.

10
00:00:42,854 --> 00:00:45,059
As more and more data are created,

11
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,645
from YouTube videos, to car sensors,

12
00:00:47,645 --> 00:00:51,260
to text messages this technique can help transform data

13
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:56,449
down in a way that helps maximize the information from the original data.
