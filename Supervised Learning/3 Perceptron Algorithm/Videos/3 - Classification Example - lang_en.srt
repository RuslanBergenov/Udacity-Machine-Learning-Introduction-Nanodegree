1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,669
Correct. Well, it seems that this data can be

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:05,564
nicely separated by a line which is this line over here,

3
00:00:05,565 --> 00:00:08,580
and it seems that most students over the line get

4
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:12,210
accepted and most students under the line get rejected.

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,825
So this line is going to be our model.

6
00:00:15,824 --> 00:00:18,300
The model makes a couple of mistakes since there are

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,019
a few blue points that are under the line and a few red points over the line.

8
00:00:22,019 --> 00:00:24,169
But we're not going to care about those.

9
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:28,245
I will say that it's safe to predict that if a point is over the line

10
00:00:28,245 --> 00:00:33,600
the student gets accepted and if it's under the line then the student gets rejected.

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,210
So based on this model we'll look at the new student that we see

12
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:39,495
that they are over here at the point 7:6 which is above the line.

13
00:00:39,494 --> 00:00:43,224
So we can assume with some confidence that the student gets accepted.

14
00:00:43,225 --> 00:00:47,070
So if you answered yes, that's the correct answer.

15
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:48,695
And now a question arises.

16
00:00:48,695 --> 00:00:51,475
The question is, how do we find this line?

17
00:00:51,475 --> 00:00:53,469
So we can kind of eyeball it.

18
00:00:53,469 --> 00:00:55,199
But the computer can't.

19
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:59,745
We'll dedicate the rest of the session to show you algorithms that will find this line,

20
00:00:59,744 --> 00:01:01,184
not only for this example,

21
00:01:01,185 --> 00:01:04,000
but for much more general and complicated cases.
