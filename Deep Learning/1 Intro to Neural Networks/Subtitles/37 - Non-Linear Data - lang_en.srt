00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,003
Now we've been dealing a lot with data sets that can be separated by a line,

2
00:00:04,003 --> 00:00:05,543
like this one over here.

3
00:00:05,543 --> 00:00:08,865
But as you can imagine the real world is much more complex than that.

4
00:00:08,865 --> 00:00:12,150
This is where neural networks can show their full potential.

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:14,970
In the next few videos we'll see how to deal with

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:17,350
more complicated data sets that require

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,109
highly non-linear boundaries such as this one over here.
