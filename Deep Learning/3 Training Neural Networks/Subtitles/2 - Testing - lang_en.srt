1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,819
So let's look at the following data form by blue and red points,

2
00:00:03,819 --> 00:00:06,628
and the following two classification models

3
00:00:06,628 --> 00:00:10,105
which separates the blue points from the red points.

4
00:00:10,105 --> 00:00:13,905
The question is which of these two models is better?

5
00:00:13,904 --> 00:00:16,689
Well, it seems like the one on the left is simpler since it's

6
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:21,980
a line and the one on the right is more complicated since it's a complex curve.

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,250
Now the one in the right makes no mistakes.

8
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:28,149
It correctly separates all the points,

9
00:00:28,149 --> 00:00:32,515
on the other hand, the one in the left does make some mistakes.

10
00:00:32,515 --> 00:00:36,429
So we're inclined to think that the one in the right is better.

11
00:00:36,429 --> 00:00:39,420
In order to really find out which one is better,

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:42,774
we introduce the concept of training and testing sets.

13
00:00:42,774 --> 00:00:48,344
We'll denote them as follows: the solid color points are the training set,

14
00:00:48,344 --> 00:00:52,414
and the points with the white inside are the testing set.

15
00:00:52,414 --> 00:00:54,670
And what we'll do is we'll train our models in

16
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:59,298
the training set without looking at the testing set,

17
00:00:59,298 --> 00:01:03,810
and then we'll evaluate the results on that testing to see how we did.

18
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:05,260
So according to this,

19
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,209
we trained the linear model and

20
00:01:07,209 --> 00:01:12,534
the complex model on the training set to obtain these two boundaries.

21
00:01:12,534 --> 00:01:17,530
Now we reintroduce the testing set and we can see that the model in

22
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:23,379
the left made one mistake while the model in the right made two mistakes.

23
00:01:23,379 --> 00:01:26,594
So in the end, the simple model was better.

24
00:01:26,593 --> 00:01:29,193
Does that match our intuition?.

25
00:01:29,194 --> 00:01:32,980
Well, it does, because in machine learning that's what we're going to do.

26
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:36,099
Whenever we can choose between a simple model that does

27
00:01:36,099 --> 00:01:40,655
the job and a complicated model that may do the job a little bit better,

28
00:01:40,655 --> 00:01:43,000
we always try to go for the simpler model.
