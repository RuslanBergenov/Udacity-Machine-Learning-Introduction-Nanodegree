1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:04,160
Yes, that is really how conversations
with recruiters can go.

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,060
Chris was able to communicate
a lot of his elevator pitch

3
00:00:07,059 --> 00:00:09,049
in the short conversation.

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:12,830
>> Talking to a stranger can be daunting
but I was relaxed and confident.

5
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:15,400
I didn't recite my elevator pitch
because I'd already practiced

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,820
it multiple times and knew I
wanted employers to know about me.

7
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,839
So it was easy to
[INAUDIBLE] a conversation.

8
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:22,649
Once the mood was set
in the conversation,

9
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:25,059
it was even easier to continue talking.

10
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:28,390
>> If we were able to continue the
conversation, I may have asked him which

11
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:31,449
other projects he worked on or
how he became interested in education.

12
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:34,200
I would have found out about
his teaching background and

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:38,179
would have been really impressed that he
was able to develop a new skill set, so

14
00:00:38,179 --> 00:00:39,880
successfully while still
working full time.

15
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:43,310
I would leave that conversation
thinking Chris was a software engineer

16
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:46,630
because he immediately proved it to
me by talking about his web app.

17
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:48,570
And that he was really
serious about learning and

18
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:51,090
education due to his
other work experiences.

19
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,560
He's the perfect engineering candidate
for an education company like Udacity.

20
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,270
>> Using an elevator
pitch to prep you for

21
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:00,590
conversations with recruiters is
probably the best way to use them,

22
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:03,590
since you're personally connecting
with someone face to face.

23
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:06,799
I also really recommend you use your
pitch as a starting point to continue

24
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,349
telling your personal narrative,
so just through blogs or podcasts.

25
00:01:10,349 --> 00:01:13,289
Employers actively try to find
job candidates on the Internet,

26
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:15,930
on job focused platforms LinkedIn and
GitHub and

27
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:19,210
on non job focused platforms,
Twitter and Medium.

28
00:01:19,209 --> 00:01:21,140
Now, I'm not actively looking for
a job but

29
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:25,120
opportunities still come to me because
of a personally branded online presence.

30
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,030
>> So when you're looking for

31
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:28,879
work, putting your personal friend
out there is like putting out

32
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,250
hundred of flyers advertising
that you're great job candidate.

33
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,879
Following this lesson,
there's some project you can use to help

34
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:37,299
optimize your online
networking profiles.

35
00:01:37,299 --> 00:01:39,980
Take advantage of them and watch
opportunities start coming your way.
