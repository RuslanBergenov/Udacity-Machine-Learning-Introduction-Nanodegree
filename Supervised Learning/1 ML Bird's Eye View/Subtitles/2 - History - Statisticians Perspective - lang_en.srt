00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,315
Current uses of machine learning

2
00:00:07,315 --> 00:00:10,205
come from the combination of two perspectives.

3
00:00:10,205 --> 00:00:15,705
One is the perspective of statisticians and the second is that of computer scientists.

4
00:00:15,705 --> 00:00:19,964
The statisticians perspective has evolved from understanding data.

5
00:00:19,964 --> 00:00:25,850
The field of data analysis was originally a field of mathematics based on questions like,

6
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:29,285
how do we better understand the mechanisms that create data?

7
00:00:29,285 --> 00:00:34,810
From these questions, probability-based models were used to model the world around us.

8
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:39,890
For example, there's a distribution to model expected scores on a test,

9
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:42,530
number of daily incidence on a stretch of road,

10
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:45,505
or how frequently words show up in a body of text.

11
00:00:45,505 --> 00:00:48,365
The derivation of distributions like these were

12
00:00:48,365 --> 00:00:51,679
breakthroughs for mechanisms that could create data in the real world.

13
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:54,755
These mathematical functions were used to describe

14
00:00:54,755 --> 00:00:57,980
essentially all aspects of our daily lives.

15
00:00:57,979 --> 00:00:59,529
But as it turns out,

16
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:01,795
these models are an over-simplification

17
00:01:01,795 --> 00:01:04,680
of the complexities that exists in the real world.

18
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,560
Often, the probability-based models that were created for a situation did not

19
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,980
do a very good job of simulating the actual data observed in the world.

20
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:16,924
In the next video,

21
00:01:16,924 --> 00:01:18,780
you will see a different perspective,

22
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,519
that of a computer scientist.

23
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:24,899
The combination of the computer scientist and statistician viewpoints results

24
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,450
in the diverse techniques used in machine learning today.
