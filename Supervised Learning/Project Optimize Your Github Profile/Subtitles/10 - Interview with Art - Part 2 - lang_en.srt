Hi, I am back with Art and now I'd like
to get into commits and commit messages.

2
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:12,020
So commits are one of the main reasons
we use Git as a version control system

3
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:13,830
so you can make these
incremental changes and

4
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:17,400
you can see what changed every
time you make a commit, and

5
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,350
a very important part of
this is the commit message.

6
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:24,800
So why is the formatting of
the commit message so important?

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,269
>> I think that,
well formatted commit messages.

8
00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:32,432
I find most important reasons to get
going because as you go through digging

9
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:36,529
through people's code or your own code
trying to figure out what's wrong

10
00:00:36,529 --> 00:00:39,250
especially when you're looking for
a bug.

11
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,970
But somebody just want to know why
a line of code is the way that it is.

12
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:43,432
>> Yeah.
>> The first thing you're going to do is

13
00:00:43,432 --> 00:00:44,550
go and get blamed.

14
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:45,500
Awesome tool.

15
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,787
And it's going to show you the committer
but also the commit message.

16
00:00:47,787 --> 00:00:52,057
And if that message is just like added
stuff, it gives you no context for

17
00:00:52,057 --> 00:00:55,910
why the code changed,
why it's there in the first place.

18
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:58,140
And that's super important.

19
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,450
It's super important for you as you
maintain your code down the line.

20
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:05,372
It's super important for people that
follow after you in maintain your code.

21
00:01:05,372 --> 00:01:10,210
And so, it's funny, I definitely
when I look at candidates and

22
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:15,170
when I dig through their GitHub I check
out to see sort of how thorough and

23
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:16,210
well they communicate-
>> Yeah.

24
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:17,160
>> in their commit message.

25
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:17,950
It's really important.
