1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,290
So, now we can calculate the weights of all our weak learners.

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:05,064
Let's remember that in the first one,

3
00:00:05,065 --> 00:00:08,370
the sum of weights of the correctly classified points is seven,

4
00:00:08,369 --> 00:00:10,779
and the sum of incorrect ones is three.

5
00:00:10,779 --> 00:00:17,119
Therefore, the weight is natural logarithm of seven divided by three, which is 0.84.

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,019
For the second one, the sum of weights of

7
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:24,164
the correctly classified points is 11 and for the incorrect ones it's three.

8
00:00:24,164 --> 00:00:30,009
So, the weight is natural logarithm of 11 over three which is 1.3.

9
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:31,825
Finally, for the third one,

10
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:36,375
the sum of correct weights is 19 and for the incorrect ones it's three again.

11
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:42,740
So, the weight is natural logarithm of 19 divided by three or 1.84.

12
00:00:42,740 --> 00:00:46,260
It sounds like the weights are increasing but don't get the wrong idea.

13
00:00:46,259 --> 00:00:48,314
That only happens in this example.

14
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:51,134
In general, they will not necessarily be increasing.

15
00:00:51,134 --> 00:00:53,390
So, now we have our three weak learners with

16
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:57,289
their corresponding weights of 0.84,1.3, and 1.84.

17
00:00:57,289 --> 00:01:01,920
To combine them, basically,

18
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,385
we make them vote except we weight the vote by the corresponding weight.

19
00:01:06,385 --> 00:01:08,359
So, for the positive area,

20
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:10,734
we'll add the weight and for the negative area,

21
00:01:10,734 --> 00:01:13,385
we'll subtract the weight. So, let's do it.

22
00:01:13,385 --> 00:01:17,810
We take the first model and add the positives and negatives of the weight to each region.

23
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:22,125
Then, we do the same thing with the second model and finally,

24
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:27,715
with the third model, and we calculate the sums which gives us these values.

25
00:01:27,715 --> 00:01:30,930
Finally, when the value is positive, then we say blue,

26
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:34,085
and when it is negative, we say red. That's it.

27
00:01:34,084 --> 00:01:38,884
That's the combination of our weak learners and we can see how it forms a strong learner.

28
00:01:38,885 --> 00:01:41,815
We can see that this model fits the data pretty well.

29
00:01:41,814 --> 00:01:44,129
That's it, that's ADABOOST.
