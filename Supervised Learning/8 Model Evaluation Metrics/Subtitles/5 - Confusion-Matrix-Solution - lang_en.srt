1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,420
So let's see. The true positives are the points that

2
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:07,140
are positive and the model correctly labels as positive.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,570
These are the six blue points over here.

4
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,880
The true negatives are the points that are

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,155
negative and the model correctly labels as negative.

6
00:00:15,155 --> 00:00:18,650
These are the five negative red points over here.

7
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:20,970
The false positives are the points that are negative

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,970
but the model incorrectly labels as positive.

9
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:26,220
These are these two red points over here.

10
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,340
And finally, the false negatives are the points that

11
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,195
are positive but the model incorrectly labels as negative.

12
00:00:33,195 --> 00:00:35,930
That's just this blue point over here.

13
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:38,130
So there we go. That's the confusion matrix.
