1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,220
Correct logarithm is the answer since it satisfies that beautiful identity that says,

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:08,385
the logarithm of a product is the sum of the logarithms.

3
00:00:08,385 --> 00:00:12,390
Thus, our product numbers becomes a sum of the logarithms of the numbers.

4
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:17,100
In this case, we get minus 3.245.

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,490
Now in this class, we'll be using log as a logarithm base two,

6
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,500
and the reason is information theory.

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,730
So here's our summary. We have our three configuration of red and blue balls.

8
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,090
Now we have the probability of the ball being red and blue,

9
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:32,250
and the product of them according to the sequence,

10
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,315
which is the probability of winning the game.

11
00:00:34,315 --> 00:00:37,085
In the next column, we'll take the logarithm base two.

12
00:00:37,085 --> 00:00:38,840
But since the numbers are less than one,

13
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:40,055
the logarithm is negative.

14
00:00:40,055 --> 00:00:42,605
Thus, if we take the negative of the whole equation,

15
00:00:42,605 --> 00:00:44,600
we're now dealing with positive numbers.

16
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,970
And in the last column, we'll just divide by four

17
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:50,180
because what we'll use as definition of entropy is the average of

18
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:52,970
the negatives of the logarithms of the probabilities

19
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:56,045
of picking the balls in a way that we win the game.

20
00:00:56,045 --> 00:00:57,830
Thus, for the first bucket,

21
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:58,985
we get 0 entropy,

22
00:00:58,985 --> 00:01:01,205
for the second one we get 0.81,

23
00:01:01,205 --> 00:01:03,290
and for the third one we get one.

24
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,870
This is going to be our formula for entropy.

25
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,670
In the slightly more general case of

26
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:10,490
five red balls and three blue balls, we get the following.

27
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:12,410
The negative of the sum of

28
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:15,770
five times the logarithm of the probability of picking a red ball,

29
00:01:15,770 --> 00:01:17,850
which is five over eight,

30
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:20,510
and three times the logarithm of the probability of picking a blue ball,

31
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,085
which is three over eight.

32
00:01:22,085 --> 00:01:25,670
We can see that this is a large number since this set has a lot of entropy.

33
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:29,705
In the more general case with m red balls and n blue balls, this is the formula.

34
00:01:29,705 --> 00:01:34,685
As the probability of picking a red ball is m divided by m plus n,

35
00:01:34,685 --> 00:01:37,580
and for a blue ball it's n divided by n plus

36
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:42,130
n. And this is the general formula for entropy when the balls can be of two colors.
