1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,120
So let's start with two questions,

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,995
what is deep learning, and what is it used for?

3
00:00:04,995 --> 00:00:08,160
The answer to the second question is pretty much everywhere.

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,009
Recent applications include things such as beating

5
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:14,349
humans in games such as Go, or even jeopardy,

6
00:00:14,349 --> 00:00:18,050
detecting spam in emails, forecasting stock prices,

7
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:20,320
recognizing images in a picture,

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,635
and even diagnosing illnesses sometimes with more precision than doctors.

9
00:00:24,635 --> 00:00:25,920
And of course, one of

10
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,850
the most celebrated applications of deep learning is in self-driving cars.

11
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:31,980
And what is at the heart of deep learning?

12
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,905
This wonderful object called neural networks.

13
00:00:34,905 --> 00:00:38,789
Neural networks vaguely mimic the process of how the brain operates,

14
00:00:38,789 --> 00:00:41,299
with neurons that fire bits of information.

15
00:00:41,299 --> 00:00:43,049
It sounds pretty scary, right?

16
00:00:43,049 --> 00:00:45,375
As a matter of fact, the first time I heard of a neural network,

17
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:47,234
this is the image that came into my head,

18
00:00:47,234 --> 00:00:50,719
some scary robot with artificial brain.

19
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,100
But then, I got to learn a bit more about neural networks and

20
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,179
I realized that there are actually a lot scarier than that.

21
00:00:56,179 --> 00:00:58,475
This is how a neural network looks.

22
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:01,800
As a matter of fact, this one here is a deep neural network.

23
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:04,319
Has lots of nodes, lots of edges,

24
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:09,029
lots of layers, information coming through the nodes and leaving, it's quite complicated.

25
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,625
But after looking at neural networks for a while,

26
00:01:11,625 --> 00:01:14,540
I realized that they're actually a lot simpler than that.

27
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,470
When I think of a neural network,

28
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:18,825
this is actually the image that comes to my mind.

29
00:01:18,825 --> 00:01:20,685
There is a child playing in the sand,

30
00:01:20,685 --> 00:01:23,900
with some red and blue shells and we are the child.

31
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,300
Can you draw a line that separates the red and the blue shells?

32
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,530
And the child draws this line.

33
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,299
That's it. That's what a neural network does.

34
00:01:32,299 --> 00:01:35,054
Given some data in the form of blue or red points,

35
00:01:35,055 --> 00:01:38,800
the neural network will look for the best line that separates them.

36
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,730
And if the data is a bit more complicated like this one over here,

37
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,079
then we'll need a more complicated algorithm.

38
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,530
Here, a deep neural network will do the job and

39
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:49,799
find a more complex boundary that separates the points.

40
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:51,045
So with that image in mind,

41
00:01:51,045 --> 00:01:53,469
let's dive in and learn about neural networks.
