1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
In this section, we'll learn a different kernel called

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:06,450
the RBF or radial basis functions kernel.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,195
So again, we have our points that we want to separate, and again,

4
00:00:09,195 --> 00:00:13,019
there is an old line that will separate them. So here's an idea.

5
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:17,469
Let's draw this little mountain range over here which is pretty conveniently drawn.

6
00:00:17,469 --> 00:00:18,980
Now, let's move every point to

7
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:22,274
its corresponding point in the mountain range. And what a coincidence.

8
00:00:22,274 --> 00:00:24,419
The red points end up in highlands,

9
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,815
whereas the blue points end up in the valleys.

10
00:00:26,815 --> 00:00:29,586
And now, we're again in a two dimensional land,

11
00:00:29,586 --> 00:00:31,175
and the points are separable.

12
00:00:31,175 --> 00:00:33,384
Here's a line that will cut them.

13
00:00:33,384 --> 00:00:38,079
And what we do is we look at where the line intersects the mountain range,

14
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:42,259
we project everything down to the original line and now, we have our boundaries.

15
00:00:42,259 --> 00:00:44,274
They're given by these vertical cuts.

16
00:00:44,274 --> 00:00:49,640
Magic. Now, that mountain range was a bit suspicious, a little too convenient.

17
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:53,070
The question is, how do we build a mountain range that will tend to locate

18
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:57,960
the red points in highlands and the blue points in lowlands? Well, here's a technique.

19
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,325
Let's actually below a mountain on top of every point.

20
00:01:01,325 --> 00:01:04,605
The technical term for these mountings is radial basis functions,

21
00:01:04,605 --> 00:01:06,780
and we'll see their formulas later.

22
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,739
So, we built some functions that looked like this,

23
00:01:08,739 --> 00:01:11,349
and now, let's consider combining these functions.

24
00:01:11,349 --> 00:01:16,765
How would we do it to build a range that helps us separate the blue and the red points?

25
00:01:16,765 --> 00:01:18,599
Here's an idea. Let's flip the middle one,

26
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:21,794
or multiply it by minus one, and now,

27
00:01:21,795 --> 00:01:23,579
add the three of them, and by adding,

28
00:01:23,579 --> 00:01:25,500
I literally mean the way you add functions,

29
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,885
so at every point, just add the three heights.

30
00:01:27,885 --> 00:01:30,045
If we add them, we get the following function.

31
00:01:30,045 --> 00:01:35,025
And now, we move the points up or down to the corresponding point in the mountain range.

32
00:01:35,025 --> 00:01:39,145
After we do this, now we can easily draw a line that splits the points in two.

33
00:01:39,144 --> 00:01:40,829
We proceed to draw this line.

34
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:42,679
Let's say at height 0.5.

35
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,820
This line will intersect the mountain range at these points.

36
00:01:46,819 --> 00:01:48,744
So, when we project down to the line,

37
00:01:48,745 --> 00:01:51,530
we get these cuts over here which are our model.

38
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:55,805
Notice that these cuts separate the blue points from the red points as we wanted.

39
00:01:55,805 --> 00:01:57,265
Now, we can go even farther.

40
00:01:57,265 --> 00:02:00,415
Before, we just added and subtracted these functions, but now,

41
00:02:00,415 --> 00:02:04,220
we can actually multiply them by any constants that we want.

42
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:05,439
We can do, for example,

43
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:11,754
two times this one minus four times this one plus one times this one,

44
00:02:11,754 --> 00:02:15,579
and let's say the sum is this.

45
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:19,835
And the line that cuts this is at height minus one.

46
00:02:19,835 --> 00:02:23,724
Great. Now, we associate this model with the weights two,

47
00:02:23,724 --> 00:02:26,810
minus four, one, and minus one.

48
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:29,705
And now, the question is how do we find this weight.

49
00:02:29,705 --> 00:02:33,755
Well, here's a way to do it. Here are three mountings or functions.

50
00:02:33,754 --> 00:02:35,769
One on top of each point.

51
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:37,370
Now, under each point,

52
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,175
let's record the value of the function at every point,

53
00:02:40,175 --> 00:02:43,505
so literally, how tall is the mountain at that point?

54
00:02:43,504 --> 00:02:46,534
For the first point, we have that the green mountain has a height one,

55
00:02:46,534 --> 00:02:49,840
since we constructed the mountain precisely to peak at that point.

56
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,733
The other two heights that are small.

57
00:02:51,733 --> 00:02:54,640
Since the yellow one, the brown mountains are pretty low at this point.

58
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:57,794
So let's say, there are 0.08 And 0.02.

59
00:02:57,794 --> 00:03:02,234
Then we do the same thing with the second point and with the third point.

60
00:03:02,235 --> 00:03:05,515
Notice that each point will have one value of one on their vector of heights,

61
00:03:05,514 --> 00:03:09,834
since the height of the mountain corresponding to that point is one by construction.

62
00:03:09,835 --> 00:03:13,250
In general, the other values will be small but we may have some close

63
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:16,625
by points that will give us high values. This doesn't matter.

64
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:18,025
Now the question is,

65
00:03:18,025 --> 00:03:20,995
how do we find the right linear combination of green, yellow,

66
00:03:20,995 --> 00:03:25,430
and brown functions which will be able to separate the blue and the red points?

67
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:27,420
Well, here's where the magic happens.

68
00:03:27,419 --> 00:03:30,039
Let's take this three height vectors and just plot them in

69
00:03:30,039 --> 00:03:33,289
a three dimensional space. Here they are.

70
00:03:33,289 --> 00:03:35,870
Notice that they're very close to being the three basis vectors,

71
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:39,569
since they have a one in each of the coordinates and almost zero on the other two.

72
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:40,959
As I stated before,

73
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,593
this isn't always the case,

74
00:03:42,592 --> 00:03:46,634
but this doesn't matter as long as it gives us a set of points that we can separate.

75
00:03:46,634 --> 00:03:49,030
And since we have as many dimensions as points,

76
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:51,219
then this space is very highly dimensional,

77
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:54,419
so chances are we'll be able to separate our points well.

78
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:58,014
So, with some luck in the application of our known SVM algorithm,

79
00:03:58,014 --> 00:04:02,214
let's say we're able to separate these red and blue points with this plane over here.

80
00:04:02,215 --> 00:04:08,965
A plane with equation say, 2x - 4y + 1z = -1.

81
00:04:08,965 --> 00:04:10,689
So, let's remember this equation.

82
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:12,854
This is going to be a useful equation.

83
00:04:12,854 --> 00:04:14,544
And the reason it's useful is the following.

84
00:04:14,544 --> 00:04:17,500
If we take the constants of the equation off the plane,

85
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,095
then they become the constants of our model,

86
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:23,635
namely our mountain range consist of finding two times this mountain

87
00:04:23,634 --> 00:04:28,154
minus four times this other one plus one times this other one.

88
00:04:28,154 --> 00:04:31,204
And the line that separates this points,

89
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:35,000
the line at height minus one for the constant term. Magic.
