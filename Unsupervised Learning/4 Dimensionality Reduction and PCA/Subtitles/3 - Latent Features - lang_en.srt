00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:08,115
To introduce PCA, let's consider an example.

2
00:00:08,115 --> 00:00:11,690
Here, we have a number of factors that are related to homes.

3
00:00:11,689 --> 00:00:15,844
But actually, there are two broad categories that these factors fall into.

4
00:00:15,845 --> 00:00:19,310
The size of the house and the neighborhood that the house is in.

5
00:00:19,309 --> 00:00:22,719
These two factors are known as latent features.

6
00:00:22,719 --> 00:00:26,184
There are features that aren't directly in our dataset,

7
00:00:26,184 --> 00:00:29,979
but encompass groupings of the features we have in our dataset.

8
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,085
Surveys, often have questions that are related to latent features.

9
00:00:34,085 --> 00:00:36,535
Take a look at these survey questions,

10
00:00:36,534 --> 00:00:41,259
can you identify which latent features are related to these questions?
