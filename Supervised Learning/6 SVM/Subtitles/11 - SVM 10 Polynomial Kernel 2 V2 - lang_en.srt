00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,339
Okay, so the kernel method was interesting,

2
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:06,719
but it gets really pretty when we look at it in higher dimensions. Check this out.

3
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:08,490
Let's say we have these points,

4
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:09,951
the red and the blue,

5
00:00:09,951 --> 00:00:11,429
and we want to split them.

6
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:13,605
The coordinates are these for the red points,

7
00:00:13,605 --> 00:00:15,150
and this for the blue points.

8
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:17,190
So again, we try to split them with a line,

9
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,075
and quickly realize that there is no line that can separate these points.

10
00:00:21,074 --> 00:00:23,519
So, we need something a bit more complicated,

11
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:25,439
and we'll use the Kernel Trick again.

12
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:28,035
I am going to show you two ways to do this.

13
00:00:28,035 --> 00:00:30,015
One, is to use a circular boundary.

14
00:00:30,015 --> 00:00:33,329
So, a circle that separates the blue points from the red points.

15
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:36,059
And the other one, is to think outside the plane.

16
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:38,804
So again, to think in higher dimensions.

17
00:00:38,804 --> 00:00:42,179
We'll now introduce a third axis, the z axis.

18
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:44,505
And now we can think that we're living in a building,

19
00:00:44,505 --> 00:00:46,710
and we're going to send the blue points to say,

20
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:48,210
the second floor of the building,

21
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,804
and the red points to say the 18th floor.

22
00:00:50,804 --> 00:00:53,393
And now, we're going to put a boundary on the tenth floor,

23
00:00:53,393 --> 00:00:55,560
and that's how we're going to separate the points.

24
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,450
These two and 18 are not arbitrary.

25
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:58,905
We'll see how they appear later.

26
00:00:58,905 --> 00:01:00,570
So, basically we have two methods.

27
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:03,149
The circle method which sacrifices the linearity,

28
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:04,739
and instead of using a linear equation,

29
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,109
it uses a higher degree polynomial equation.

30
00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:10,650
And the building method which sacrifices the dimensionality of the data,

31
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:12,750
and now you don't have data in two dimensions,

32
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,775
instead you have it in three dimensions.

33
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:16,920
You still have linear boundaries in this method,

34
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,570
but you have more dimensions.

35
00:01:18,569 --> 00:01:20,399
So the question is,

36
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,908
which one do you like more?

37
00:01:21,908 --> 00:01:24,000
The circle or the building method?

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,424
I'll let you think about it.

39
00:01:26,424 --> 00:01:28,384
And I'll tell you,

40
00:01:28,385 --> 00:01:29,885
they're actually the same method,

41
00:01:29,885 --> 00:01:31,565
and this is the kernel method.

42
00:01:31,564 --> 00:01:33,694
And I'll show you why they are the same.

43
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:35,449
So, let's look at the points again,

44
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:38,450
and as we saw no linear function can separate them.

45
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:42,875
So, maybe we need a different function to help us separate them. And here's a quiz.

46
00:01:42,875 --> 00:01:44,329
It's not a super-easy quiz.

47
00:01:44,329 --> 00:01:45,875
So, I'd like you to think about it.

48
00:01:45,875 --> 00:01:48,200
Which equation on the variables x and y,

49
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,805
the two coordinates of the point,

50
00:01:49,805 --> 00:01:53,390
could come to our rescue when it comes to separating the points?

51
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,224
The sum of the coordinates x plus y,

52
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:59,254
the product of the coordinates x times y,

53
00:01:59,254 --> 00:02:01,459
or the sum of the squares of the coordinates,

54
00:02:01,459 --> 00:02:03,394
x squared plus y squared?

55
00:02:03,394 --> 00:02:06,530
So, think about it. If x and y are the coordinates of the point,

56
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:10,430
which one of these three functions can help us separate the points?

57
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:12,750
Enter your answer below.
