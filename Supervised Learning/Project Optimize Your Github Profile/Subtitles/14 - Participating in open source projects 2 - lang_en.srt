00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:03,520
Let's go over how you can start
contributing to open source projects.

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,810
This is one of my favorite libraries,
pandas.

3
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:09,630
Here we can see a list of
issues that users have created.

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,410
Contributing to the project can
be as simple as helping a user

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,220
with one of these issues.

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,890
Of course you can also
create your own issues.

7
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:21,390
These can be feature requests,
bugs you run into, or

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,190
things in the documentation that
you find unclear, incorrect.

9
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:27,840
Be sure to be nice this is all public.

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,350
As Art said, one of the best
ways to start contributing,

11
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:32,870
is by improving the documentation.

12
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:34,920
Here's an issue related
to the documentation.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,835
If you are working on this library,
you could take on this issue,

14
00:00:38,835 --> 00:00:41,770
fix the documentation and
make a pool request.

15
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,080
Finally you can create a list a
repositories you like by starting them.

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,020
Also if you watch for repository,
you'll be notified of any changes.

17
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:52,900
This is a great way to keep up with a
library you're interested in working on.
