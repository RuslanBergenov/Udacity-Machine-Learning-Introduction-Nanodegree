1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,705
Here's another way to prevent overfitting.

2
00:00:02,705 --> 00:00:04,448
So, let's say this is you,

3
00:00:04,448 --> 00:00:07,589
and one day you decide to practice sports.

4
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:09,823
So, on Monday you play tennis,

5
00:00:09,823 --> 00:00:11,759
on Tuesday you lift weights,

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,070
on Wednesday you play American football,

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:16,245
on Thursday you play baseball,

8
00:00:16,245 --> 00:00:18,344
on Friday you play basketball,

9
00:00:18,344 --> 00:00:20,644
and on Saturday you play ping pong.

10
00:00:20,643 --> 00:00:22,648
Now, after a week you've kind of

11
00:00:22,649 --> 00:00:25,739
noticed that you've done most of them with your dominant hand.

12
00:00:25,739 --> 00:00:31,254
So, you're developing a large muscle on that arm but not on the other arm.

13
00:00:31,254 --> 00:00:33,265
This is disappointing.

14
00:00:33,265 --> 00:00:34,793
So, what can you do?

15
00:00:34,793 --> 00:00:36,839
Well, let's spice it up on the next week.

16
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,630
What we'll do is on Monday we'll tie

17
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:44,054
our right hand behind our back and try to play tennis with the left hand.

18
00:00:44,054 --> 00:00:46,770
On Tuesday, we'll tie our left hand

19
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,500
behind your back and try to lift weights with the right hand.

20
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,243
Then on Wednesday again,

21
00:00:52,243 --> 00:00:56,250
we'll tie our right hand and play American football with the left one.

22
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,850
On Thursday we'll take it easy and play baseball with both hands, that's fine.

23
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:05,500
Then, on Friday we'll tie both hands behind our back and try to play basketball.

24
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,875
That won't work out too well.

25
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:09,409
But it's OK. It's the training process.

26
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:10,995
And then on Saturday again,

27
00:01:10,995 --> 00:01:15,635
we tie our left hand behind our back and play ping pong with the right.

28
00:01:15,635 --> 00:01:21,314
After a week, we see that we've developed both of our biceps. Pretty good job.

29
00:01:21,313 --> 00:01:25,029
This is something that happens a lot when we train neural networks.

30
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,858
Sometimes one part of the network has

31
00:01:26,858 --> 00:01:30,578
very large weights and it ends up dominating all the training,

32
00:01:30,578 --> 00:01:33,369
while another part of the network doesn't

33
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:36,504
really play much of a role so it doesn't get trained.

34
00:01:36,504 --> 00:01:39,359
So, what we'll do to solve this is sometimes during training,

35
00:01:39,358 --> 00:01:43,084
we'll turn this part off and let the rest of the network train.

36
00:01:43,084 --> 00:01:46,343
More thoroughly, what we do is as we go through the epochs,

37
00:01:46,343 --> 00:01:49,673
we randomly turn off some of the nodes and say,

38
00:01:49,674 --> 00:01:52,129
you shall not pass through here.

39
00:01:52,129 --> 00:01:54,609
In that case, the other nodes have to pick up

40
00:01:54,608 --> 00:01:57,905
the slack and take more part in the training.

41
00:01:57,905 --> 00:02:03,549
So, for example, in the first epoch we're not allowed to use this node.

42
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:08,664
So, we do our feat forward and our back propagation passes without using it.

43
00:02:08,663 --> 00:02:10,655
In the second epoch,

44
00:02:10,655 --> 00:02:13,503
we can't use these two nodes.

45
00:02:13,503 --> 00:02:16,204
Again, we do our feet forward and back prop.

46
00:02:16,205 --> 00:02:20,965
And in the third epoch we can't use these nodes over here.

47
00:02:20,965 --> 00:02:25,289
So, again, we do forward and back prop.

48
00:02:25,288 --> 00:02:27,309
And finally in last epoch,

49
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:29,818
we can't use these two nodes over here.

50
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:31,598
So, we continue like that.

51
00:02:31,598 --> 00:02:36,158
What we'll do to drop the nodes is we'll give the algorithm a parameter.

52
00:02:36,158 --> 00:02:42,218
This parameter is the probability that each node gets dropped at a particular epoch.

53
00:02:42,218 --> 00:02:46,358
For example, if we give it a 0.2 it means each epoch,

54
00:02:46,359 --> 00:02:51,264
each node gets turned off with a probability of 20 percent.

55
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,770
Notice that some nodes may get turned off more than

56
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:56,810
others and some others may never get turned off.

57
00:02:56,810 --> 00:03:00,068
And this is OK since we're doing it over and over and over.

58
00:03:00,068 --> 00:03:03,209
On average each node will get the same treatment.

59
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,560
This method is called dropout and it's really

60
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,259
really common and useful to train neural networks.
