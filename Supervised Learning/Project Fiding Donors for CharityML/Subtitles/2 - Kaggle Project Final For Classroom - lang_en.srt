00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,345
So, with Kaggle, you can actually set up your own competitions?

2
00:00:03,345 --> 00:00:04,080
Yes. Absolutely.

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,200
We're going to set up a competition for students to be able to

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,544
share their work through Kaggle and just get them onto the Kaggle platform.

5
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:12,269
How can they go about doing that?

6
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:13,799
How easy is that process?

7
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:16,230
How easy is it to get integrated into the community?

8
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,870
Yeah. I'm going to, answer it backwards.

9
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:22,260
So, getting integrated into the community, pretty straightforward.

10
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,330
People are fairly welcoming.

11
00:00:24,329 --> 00:00:27,149
You can just write your Kernel,

12
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:29,070
make it public, and post on the forums,

13
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,170
you know, can I get some feedback? What do you guys think?

14
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,195
Here's my approach to this problem, what would you do?

15
00:00:33,195 --> 00:00:35,750
And people tend to be pretty responsive and interested,

16
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,810
because it's a large community and people are really excited about data science.

17
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:40,530
Do you know how large the community is?

18
00:00:40,530 --> 00:00:44,045
We definitely have over a million registered users.

19
00:00:44,045 --> 00:00:44,645
Okay.

20
00:00:44,645 --> 00:00:45,455
Yeah.

21
00:00:45,454 --> 00:00:47,539
That great. I mean that's a huge community.

22
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:49,884
Yeah. No, it is. And it feels vibrant.

23
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:50,640
Yeah.

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,000
We also have something called In-class.

25
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,515
Which is a way that you can set up your own competitions.

26
00:00:54,515 --> 00:00:58,365
So, you would pick a data set,

27
00:00:58,365 --> 00:01:00,980
and then you split it

28
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:03,559
into testing and training just like you would. So, no one would see.

29
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,240
So, testing and training for people to see,

30
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:08,454
and then a third validation set that nobody would see. So, it would be hidden.

31
00:01:08,454 --> 00:01:12,125
And then you would give people access to it and they would train their models,

32
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:18,519
and then upload their answer file for the, you know, the-

33
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:20,099
What they think should happen. Yeah. Right.

34
00:01:20,099 --> 00:01:23,729
Yeah exactly. Then you'd validate it against the specific,

35
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:26,260
the secret, validation data set

36
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:29,329
and then ranking based on whatever sort of metric you're using.

37
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:31,409
So, if you were just looking at,

38
00:01:31,489 --> 00:01:34,909
you probably wouldn't use like raw percent correct.

39
00:01:34,909 --> 00:01:36,079
You could if you wanted to, right.

40
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,250
If it was sort of a problem that made sense there.

41
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:40,650
But I've seen people use these for obviously,

42
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,555
In-class, hence the name.

43
00:01:42,555 --> 00:01:47,330
But also, if you just like, when you do a hackathon or just a project for some friends,

44
00:01:47,329 --> 00:01:48,935
or like a little friendly competition.

45
00:01:48,935 --> 00:01:50,640
Yeah, cool.
