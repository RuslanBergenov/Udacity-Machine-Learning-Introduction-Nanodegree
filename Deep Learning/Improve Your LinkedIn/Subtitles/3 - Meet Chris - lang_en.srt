00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,857
Hey Chris.

2
00:00:00,857 --> 00:00:03,299
>> Hi Trinh.

3
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:06,359
>> Over the past year that we've been
working together on the careers team at

4
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:09,990
Udacity, you've developed so
much, so many of our web apps, so

5
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:14,250
many of our data backend, and I was
really surprised when I learned that

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,460
you've actually only been a software
engineer for a year, and so

7
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,300
I'm just really curious
to see how you got here?

8
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:21,050
>> Yeah, that's right.

9
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:23,940
I've been a software engineer
at Udacity for a year,

10
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:29,780
and my career I guess started
a little bit more than ten years ago.

11
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:34,910
I was originally a admission counselor,
and I got into tutoring and teaching.

12
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:38,379
I even did a stint as an administrator
working at a psychiatrist office

13
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,960
learning about medicine and
health insurance.

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,329
>> Well that's like a really
diverse background.

15
00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:48,019
How did you end up from a psychiatrist
office to being a software engineer?

16
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:50,680
>> So, it was definitely a long,
winding road.

17
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:51,350
I think for

18
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:55,260
me, I first got curious about software
engineering through teaching.

19
00:00:55,259 --> 00:01:00,549
I made some courses at Udacity, in math
and data analysis and product design.

20
00:01:00,549 --> 00:01:03,099
And along the way,
I picked up coding skills, so

21
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,689
I learned a little bit about Python,
I learned JavaScript.

22
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:07,739
I learned how to think computationally,

23
00:01:07,739 --> 00:01:10,159
how to think kind of more
like a computer scientist.

24
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,829
And I've just been learning ever since.

25
00:01:12,829 --> 00:01:17,539
And for me, I think,
the biggest thing was trying to

26
00:01:18,769 --> 00:01:23,479
acquire all those skills and then
convince people that I had enough skills

27
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:26,660
to build something and
to contribute to a larger organization.

28
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:27,979
>> That's great that
you brought that up.

29
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:31,010
I speak with a lot of people about
their career development and so

30
00:01:31,010 --> 00:01:32,290
many of them took the initiative,

31
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:36,990
like you, to learn on their own time,
some while they're working full time.

32
00:01:36,989 --> 00:01:40,280
But they still kind of face
a barrier in that the it's hard for

33
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,230
them to convince people that,
yes I am qualified and

34
00:01:44,230 --> 00:01:48,049
yes even though I don't have background
in this job, I can still do it.

35
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:50,049
How did you approach that problem?

36
00:01:50,049 --> 00:01:55,030
>> Yeah, I mean it's certainly a hard
one and I think it's easy to feel like

37
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:57,980
you're an imposter, or
you don't have enough skills.

38
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:02,650
And I think the biggest thing you can
do is one, practice, but also two,

39
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:05,780
tell yourself that you
are a software engineer.

40
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,879
Talk about your projects.

41
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:09,150
Talk about them technically
with other people.

42
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:12,349
That will build your confidence
in your own abilities and

43
00:02:12,349 --> 00:02:16,009
your ability to communicate
that you can do this work.

44
00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:21,060
So I think for me, I know one of the
things that I had to do was just kind of

45
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,069
turn off that voice in my head
that says you're not good enough.

46
00:02:24,069 --> 00:02:25,709
Or you don't know enough things.

47
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:29,590
Just turn off that imposter syndrome
entirely and talk about what I can do,

48
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,930
what I have done.

49
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:35,180
And that's what can really
help you get an interview and

50
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,830
succeed in those interviews.

51
00:02:36,830 --> 00:02:39,956
>> A lot of people when they're
transitioning to a new career for

52
00:02:39,955 --> 00:02:43,562
the first time, it's really hard for
them to introduce themselves and

53
00:02:43,562 --> 00:02:47,228
package everything that you just said
about yourself into kind of a short

54
00:02:47,229 --> 00:02:48,879
introduction to other people.

55
00:02:48,878 --> 00:02:51,658
So do you have any strategies on
how people can approach talking

56
00:02:51,658 --> 00:02:53,603
to other people about
their career change?

57
00:02:53,604 --> 00:02:57,141
>> Yeah I think one of the best
things that you can do is to use

58
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,429
an elevator pitch.
