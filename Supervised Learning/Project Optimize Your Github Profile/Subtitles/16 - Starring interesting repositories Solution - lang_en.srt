00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:03,520
As you were working on the rest of your
nano degree, keep in mind that it's

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,640
a good idea to contribute somehow
to an open source project.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,820
If you don't know where to start,

4
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,390
look through the documentation
if it's a typo.

5
00:00:10,390 --> 00:00:13,370
Or if there is something in
the documentation that isn't clear,

6
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,100
create an issue about it and
ask for help.

7
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,497
Then you can rewrite that part and
make a poll request.
