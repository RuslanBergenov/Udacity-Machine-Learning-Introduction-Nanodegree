1
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:07,140
Let's look a bit closer into Cross-Entropy by switching to a different example.

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,935
Let's say we have three doors.

3
00:00:08,935 --> 00:00:11,330
And no this is not the Monty Hall problem.

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:13,775
We have the green door, the red door,

5
00:00:13,775 --> 00:00:18,720
and the blue door, and behind each door we could have a gift or not have a gift.

6
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,150
And the probabilities of there being a gift behind each door is 0.8 for the first one,

7
00:00:23,150 --> 00:00:24,935
0.7 for the second one,

8
00:00:24,935 --> 00:00:26,900
0.1 for the third one.

9
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,805
So for example behind the green door

10
00:00:29,805 --> 00:00:33,155
there is an 80 percent probability of there being a gift,

11
00:00:33,155 --> 00:00:36,780
and a 20 percent probability of there not being a gift.

12
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:39,610
So we can put the information in this table where

13
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:42,970
the probabilities of there being a gift are given in the top row,

14
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:46,630
and the probabilities of there not being a gift are given in the bottom row.

15
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,180
So let's say we want to make a bet on the outcomes.

16
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:53,375
So we want to try to figure out what is the most likely scenario here.

17
00:00:53,375 --> 00:00:56,880
And for that we'll assume they're independent events.

18
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,870
In this case, the most likely scenario is just

19
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:03,440
obtained by picking the largest probability in each column.

20
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,875
So for the first door is more likely to have a gift than not have a gift.

21
00:01:06,875 --> 00:01:09,230
So we'll say there's a gift behind the first door.

22
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,680
For the second door, it's also more likely that there's a gift.

23
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,995
So we'll say there's a gift behind the second door.

24
00:01:14,995 --> 00:01:18,060
And for the third door it's much more likely that there's no gift,

25
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,015
so we'll say there's no gift behind the third door.

26
00:01:21,015 --> 00:01:22,700
And as the events are independent,

27
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:24,810
the probability for this whole arrangement is

28
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,995
the product of the three probabilities which is 0.8,

29
00:01:27,995 --> 00:01:31,096
times 0.7, times 0.9,

30
00:01:31,096 --> 00:01:33,446
which ends up being 0.504,

31
00:01:33,446 --> 00:01:36,665
which is roughly 50 percent.

32
00:01:36,665 --> 00:01:39,680
So let's look at all the possible scenarios in the table.

33
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,085
Here's a table with all the possible scenarios for each door

34
00:01:43,085 --> 00:01:46,940
and there are eight scenarios since each door gives us two possibilities each,

35
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,815
and there are three doors.

36
00:01:48,815 --> 00:01:51,545
So we do as before to obtain the probability of

37
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:57,245
each arrangement by multiplying the three independent probabilities to get these numbers.

38
00:01:57,245 --> 00:01:59,590
You can check that these numbers add to one.

39
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:02,570
And from last video we learned that the negative

40
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:05,955
of the logarithm of the probabilities across entropy.

41
00:02:05,955 --> 00:02:09,050
So let's go ahead and calculate the cross-entropy.

42
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:12,080
And notice that the events with high probability have

43
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,345
low cross-entropy and the events with low probability have high cross-entropy.

44
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:19,130
For example, the second row which has probability of

45
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:24,440
0.504 gives a small cross-entropy of 0.69,

46
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,675
and the second to last row which is very very unlikely has a probability of

47
00:02:28,675 --> 00:02:34,441
0.006 gives a cross entropy a 5.12.

48
00:02:34,441 --> 00:02:37,573
So let's actually calculate a formula for the cross-entropy.

49
00:02:37,573 --> 00:02:39,215
Here we have our three doors,

50
00:02:39,215 --> 00:02:44,180
and our sample scenario said that there is a gift behind the first and second doors,

51
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:46,445
and no gift behind the third door.

52
00:02:46,445 --> 00:02:49,370
Recall that the probabilities of these events happening

53
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:52,189
are 0.8 for a gift behind the first door,

54
00:02:52,189 --> 00:02:54,665
0.7 for a gift behind the second door,

55
00:02:54,665 --> 00:02:57,915
and 0.9 for no gift behind the third door.

56
00:02:57,915 --> 00:02:59,510
So when we calculate the cross-entropy,

57
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:03,622
we get the negative of the logarithm of the product,

58
00:03:03,622 --> 00:03:08,015
which is a sum of the negatives of the logarithms of the factors,

59
00:03:08,015 --> 00:03:14,070
which is negative logarithm of 0.8 minus logarithm of 0.7 minus logarithm 0.9.

60
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:17,225
And in order to drive the formula we'll have some variables.

61
00:03:17,225 --> 00:03:20,885
So let's call P1 the probability that there's a gift behind the first door,

62
00:03:20,885 --> 00:03:24,110
P2 the probability there's a gift behind the second door,

63
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:27,940
and P3 the probability there's a gift behind the third door.

64
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,580
So this 0.8 here is P1,

65
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,580
this 0.7 here is P2,

66
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,370
and this 0.9 here is one minus P3.

67
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,990
So it's a probability of there not being

68
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:41,460
a gift is one minus the probability of there being a gift.

69
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,785
Let's have another variable called Yi,

70
00:03:43,785 --> 00:03:46,980
which will be one of there's a present behind the ith door,

71
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,750
and zero there's no present.

72
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:53,470
So Yi is technically a number of presents behind the ith door.

73
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,442
In this case Y1 equals one,

74
00:03:55,442 --> 00:04:00,210
Y2 equals one, and Y3 equals zero.

75
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:02,550
So we can put all this together and derive a formula

76
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:05,355
for the cross-entropy and it's this sum.

77
00:04:05,355 --> 00:04:08,305
Now let's look at the formula inside the summation.

78
00:04:08,305 --> 00:04:12,155
Noted that if there is a present behind the ith door,

79
00:04:12,155 --> 00:04:14,300
then Yi equals one.

80
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,180
So the first term is logarithm of the Pi.

81
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:19,795
And the second term is zero.

82
00:04:19,795 --> 00:04:24,285
Likewise, if there is no present behind the ith door,

83
00:04:24,285 --> 00:04:26,355
then Yi is zero.

84
00:04:26,355 --> 00:04:28,355
So this first term is zero.

85
00:04:28,355 --> 00:04:32,655
And this term is precisely logarithm of one minus Pi.

86
00:04:32,655 --> 00:04:35,785
Therefore, this formula really encompasses the sums of the

87
00:04:35,785 --> 00:04:39,935
negative of logarithms which is precisely the cross-entropy.

88
00:04:39,935 --> 00:04:45,640
So the cross-entropy really tells us when two vectors are similar or different.

89
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:52,170
For example, if you calculate the cross entropy of the pair one one zero,

90
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:53,485
and 0.8, 0.7, 0.1, we get 0.69.

91
00:04:53,485 --> 00:05:00,500
And that is low because one one zero is a similar vector to 0.8, 0.7, 0.1.

92
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:05,510
Which means that the arrangement of gifts given by the first set of

93
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:08,270
numbers is likely to happen based

94
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,715
on the probabilities given by the second set of numbers.

95
00:05:11,715 --> 00:05:17,107
But on the other hand if we calculate the cross-entropy of the pairs zero zero one,

96
00:05:17,107 --> 00:05:19,559
and 0.8, 0.7, 0.1,

97
00:05:19,559 --> 00:05:23,210
that is 5.12 which is very high.

98
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:27,380
This is because the arrangement of gifts being given by the first set of numbers is

99
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:32,030
very unlikely to happen from the probabilities given by the second set of numbers.
