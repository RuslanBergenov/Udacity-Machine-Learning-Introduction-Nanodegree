1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,299
Okay, now, let's get into a slightly more complicated problem.

2
00:00:03,299 --> 00:00:07,199
Let's look at this dataset over here and two possible boundary lines.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,019
There's this one here and this one over here.

4
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:11,806
And now I want you to think,

5
00:00:11,807 --> 00:00:15,044
which one of these two looks better?

6
00:00:15,044 --> 00:00:19,649
So, maybe some of you said the one on the left and some of you said the one on the right.

7
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:21,644
In reality, there's no answer.

8
00:00:21,644 --> 00:00:24,059
In some cases, we'll prefer the one on the left

9
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:26,789
and in some cases we'll prefer the one on the right.

10
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:28,649
If it's a medical model, for example,

11
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:30,552
we wouldn't want to make any mistakes,

12
00:00:30,553 --> 00:00:32,300
so we'd prefer the one on the right.

13
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:33,699
But maybe in other cases,

14
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,800
we'll prefer the one on the left because we're okay making

15
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:38,604
some mistakes as long as we have a well-spaced boundary.

16
00:00:38,604 --> 00:00:42,009
So, it depends a lot on the data and the problem that we're approaching,

17
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:44,814
which means that we need some flexibility here.

18
00:00:44,814 --> 00:00:48,759
That flexibility is going to be provided by the C parameter.

19
00:00:48,759 --> 00:00:54,204
The C parameter is just a constant that attaches itself to the classification error.

20
00:00:54,204 --> 00:00:58,195
That means, we multiply the classification error by the constant.

21
00:00:58,195 --> 00:01:00,160
So what happens is the following.

22
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:01,959
If we have a very large C,

23
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,540
then the error is mostly the classification error,

24
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:09,035
so we're focusing more on correctly classifying our points than in finding a good margin.

25
00:01:09,034 --> 00:01:10,500
But if the C is very small,

26
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,269
then the error is mostly a margin error,

27
00:01:12,269 --> 00:01:16,905
so we're focusing mostly on a large margin than on classifying the points correctly.

28
00:01:16,905 --> 00:01:19,540
So, here's a cheat sheet for you to remember.

29
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:23,790
A small C is going to give you a large margin and then make some classification errors,

30
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,100
whereas a large C will classify points very

31
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:29,280
well but the payoff will be that it may have a very small margin.

32
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,945
And the C is a hyperparameter,

33
00:01:30,944 --> 00:01:32,369
and in order to tune it correctly,

34
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:35,800
we'll have to use techniques such as grid search, et cetera.
