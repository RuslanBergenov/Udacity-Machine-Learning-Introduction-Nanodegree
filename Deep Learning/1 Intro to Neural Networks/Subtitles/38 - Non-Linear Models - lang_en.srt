1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,459
So, let's go back to this example of where we saw

2
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:04,769
some data that is not linearly separable.

3
00:00:04,769 --> 00:00:09,740
So a line can not divide these red and blue points and we looked at some solutions,

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:14,185
and if you remember, the one we considered more seriously was this curve over here.

5
00:00:14,185 --> 00:00:18,664
So what I'll teach you now is to find this curve and it's very similar than before.

6
00:00:18,664 --> 00:00:20,519
We'll still use grading dissent.

7
00:00:20,518 --> 00:00:23,009
In a nutshell, what we're going to do is for

8
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:25,769
these data which is not separable with a line,

9
00:00:25,768 --> 00:00:30,599
we're going to create a probability function where the points in the blue region are more

10
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:36,240
likely to be blue and the points in the red region are more likely to be red.

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:39,798
And this curve here that separates them is

12
00:00:39,798 --> 00:00:44,329
a set of points which are equally likely to be blue or red.

13
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:47,789
Everything will be the same as before except this equation

14
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:52,000
won't be linear and that's where neural networks come into play.
