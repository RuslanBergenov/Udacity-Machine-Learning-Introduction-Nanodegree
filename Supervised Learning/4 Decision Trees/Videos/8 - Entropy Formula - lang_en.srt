00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
In order to cook up a formula for entropy,

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,750
we'll consider the following game.

3
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:06,540
In this game, we'll start with a configuration of balls;

4
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,955
say red, red, red,

5
00:00:08,955 --> 00:00:12,150
and blue, and we'll put them inside the bucket.

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:15,509
Now, what we do is we pick four balls out of this bucket with

7
00:00:15,509 --> 00:00:18,585
repetition and we try to get the initial configuration;

8
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:22,440
red, red, red, blue and if we do, we win.

9
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,140
Let's say we pick our first ball and it's red.

10
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:28,080
We record the color and put it back.

11
00:00:28,079 --> 00:00:30,464
Then, we pick a second ball and it's red.

12
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:33,030
So, we again record the color and put it back.

13
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:34,575
Then, we pick a third ball,

14
00:00:34,575 --> 00:00:37,965
say red and record the color and put it back.

15
00:00:37,965 --> 00:00:40,110
Notice that we pick the same ball again.

16
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:43,469
This is completely okay. Finally, we pick a fourth ball.

17
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:46,515
Now, we got blue, we record it, and put it back.

18
00:00:46,515 --> 00:00:48,105
We recorded red, red, red,

19
00:00:48,104 --> 00:00:49,889
blue. So, we win a lot of money.

20
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,484
If say we got the colors red,

21
00:00:52,484 --> 00:00:56,789
blue, blue, red, then we will win no money at all.

22
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:59,504
That's the game. Now, the quiz question is,

23
00:00:59,505 --> 00:01:02,190
which one of the three buckets is the best to play the game

24
00:01:02,189 --> 00:01:06,200
with and which one is the worst? Enter your answer below.
