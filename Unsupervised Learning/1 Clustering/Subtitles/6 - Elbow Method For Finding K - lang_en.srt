1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,214
You've now had some practice

2
00:00:07,214 --> 00:00:09,300
with identifying the number of clusters in the data

3
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:12,530
set when you can clearly see clusterings of point,

4
00:00:12,529 --> 00:00:17,884
as well as when there are some preconceived ideas about how many clusters might exist.

5
00:00:17,885 --> 00:00:22,365
But what about when you have no idea how many clusters might be in the data?

6
00:00:22,364 --> 00:00:26,509
How might we determine the k in k-means for these cases?

7
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:31,100
For this I would like to introduce a method known as the Elbow Method.

8
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,679
The way this works is that for any set of data,

9
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:38,189
we could try fitting k-means with differing numbers of k,

10
00:00:38,189 --> 00:00:41,250
then for each value of k we can measure

11
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:46,210
the the average distance of each point from the center point of the cluster.

12
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:50,490
If we kept track of the average distance for each value of k,

13
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:52,825
we could create a plot that looks like this.

14
00:00:52,825 --> 00:00:58,315
On the x-axis, you can see that we have the number of clusters or k. On

15
00:00:58,314 --> 00:01:01,375
the y-axis we have the average distance of

16
00:01:01,375 --> 00:01:05,640
each point from the center of the cluster across all of the clusters.

17
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,510
You can see here as the number of clusters increases,

18
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,859
the average distance from each point to the center decreases.

19
00:01:13,859 --> 00:01:16,804
However, with each additional center,

20
00:01:16,805 --> 00:01:19,945
the impact on the average distance is not the same.

21
00:01:19,944 --> 00:01:21,769
With small values of k,

22
00:01:21,769 --> 00:01:25,875
each additional center greatly decreases the average distance.

23
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:30,064
With larger values of k this makes less and less of an impact.

24
00:01:30,064 --> 00:01:34,579
The main point of interest in this plot is what is known as the Elbow.

25
00:01:34,579 --> 00:01:38,039
At this point, we have found a number of clusters that

26
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,695
significantly reduces the distance from each point to the center of the cluster.

27
00:01:42,694 --> 00:01:47,879
At the same time increasing k does not appear to have a substantial impact.

28
00:01:47,879 --> 00:01:51,449
Finding the Elbow can be a bit of a judgement call.

29
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,920
You're looking for the point when increasing k no

30
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,335
longer leads to a large decrease in the distance from the centers.

31
00:01:58,334 --> 00:02:00,799
Let's get some practice with this.
