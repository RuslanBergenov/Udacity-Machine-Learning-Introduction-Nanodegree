1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Well, let's remember that accuracy is a ratio between  

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,300
the correctly classified points and the total number of points.

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,960
We notice that there are six points correctly classified as positive,

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,120
and five correctly classified as negative.

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,260
These add to eleven correctly classified points.

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,255
Since the total number of points is fourteen,

7
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:22,740
We conclude that the answer is equal to eleven divided by fourteen,

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:28,740
which gives an answer of 78.57%.
