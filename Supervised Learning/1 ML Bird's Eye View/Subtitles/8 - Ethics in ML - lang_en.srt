00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:11,455
Machine Learning Models have the power to summarize data efficiently and intelligently.

2
00:00:11,455 --> 00:00:16,719
Unfortunately, since the data in our world often holds errors and biases,

3
00:00:16,719 --> 00:00:20,539
the models we build will hold the same errors and biases.

4
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:24,219
As an example, imagine you want to build a model to predict

5
00:00:24,219 --> 00:00:28,109
who the best candidate is for a job based on existing data.

6
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:33,765
If there were biases and historical hiring patterns based on gender, race, age,

7
00:00:33,765 --> 00:00:36,140
economic status et cetera,

8
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:41,870
these biases are going to be held by any predictive model you build based on these data.

9
00:00:41,869 --> 00:00:45,299
Unfortunately, the bias held by humans will

10
00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:49,744
transfer to computers so long as humans are the creators of the data.

11
00:00:49,744 --> 00:00:54,149
Images, text, speech, and video are

12
00:00:54,149 --> 00:00:59,254
all data being ingested by computers in today's world to make data-based decisions.

13
00:00:59,255 --> 00:01:01,880
But humans generate these data.

14
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:05,609
The potential biases in the data created as a result of

15
00:01:05,609 --> 00:01:10,265
our human biases should always be on your mind when building your models.

16
00:01:10,265 --> 00:01:18,599
Real-world validation of your models is even more important than statistical validation.
