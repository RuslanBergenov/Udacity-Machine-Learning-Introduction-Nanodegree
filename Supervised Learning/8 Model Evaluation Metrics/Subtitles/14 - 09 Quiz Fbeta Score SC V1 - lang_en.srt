1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,069
Now that we learned F1 score,

2
00:00:02,069 --> 00:00:05,719
let's introduce something a bit more general. Here's the concept.

3
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:08,980
If we have precision over here and recall over here,

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,475
then F1 score is somewhere around the middle.

5
00:00:11,474 --> 00:00:13,515
That gives us much importance to both.

6
00:00:13,515 --> 00:00:15,040
Of course, if one of them is smaller,

7
00:00:15,039 --> 00:00:17,799
it raises a flag, but it treats them both the same.

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,320
Now let's say our model cares a bit more about precision than recall,

9
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,914
then we want something more skewed towards precision.

10
00:00:23,914 --> 00:00:27,399
So, we'll say it's F0.5 score.

11
00:00:27,399 --> 00:00:28,714
So we call that beta.

12
00:00:28,714 --> 00:00:31,629
Beta is 0.5. The smaller the beta,

13
00:00:31,629 --> 00:00:33,629
the more towards precision that we get.

14
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:37,140
Or if we want our model to care more about the recall than one or other direction,

15
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:38,295
we pick a larger beta.

16
00:00:38,295 --> 00:00:39,579
Say beta equals 2,

17
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:41,574
so our metric is F2.

18
00:00:41,575 --> 00:00:43,480
If you like formulas, here they are.

19
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:47,579
Remember that the F1 score is 2 times precision times recall,

20
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:49,989
divided by precision plus recall.

21
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:52,760
The formula for beta, you just introduce a beta over here,

22
00:00:52,759 --> 00:00:56,059
that will skew your formula towards either one or the other one,

23
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:00,170
depending on if beta is small or large. So, let's see.

24
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:02,304
If we have the fraud detection example,

25
00:01:02,304 --> 00:01:04,189
which beta should we use?

26
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:07,370
I would initially think that this needs to be a high recall model,

27
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,530
since we need to catch all the fraud cases,

28
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:13,305
and it's okay if we accidentally detect and investigate some that are not.

29
00:01:13,305 --> 00:01:14,895
So something like F10.

30
00:01:14,894 --> 00:01:17,310
But then maybe, we're sacrificing too much precision,

31
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,165
and we're accidentally sending our customers

32
00:01:19,165 --> 00:01:22,700
too many notifications about their transactions without them being fraudulent,

33
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,780
and they're starting to get annoyed.

34
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,185
So, we can move a bit toward say F2.

35
00:01:26,185 --> 00:01:28,939
But then maybe we discover that we need to focus a bit more on

36
00:01:28,939 --> 00:01:32,118
recall because we really don't want to miss too many fraudulent transactions,

37
00:01:32,118 --> 00:01:34,435
so we go here to F5.

38
00:01:34,435 --> 00:01:36,210
It's not an exact science.

39
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:38,899
Finding a good value of beta requires a lot

40
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,965
of intuition of your data and a lot of experimentation.

41
00:01:41,965 --> 00:01:44,350
Now, let's test our knowledge. Let's have a quiz.

42
00:01:44,349 --> 00:01:46,844
So, let's look at three possible models.

43
00:01:46,844 --> 00:01:48,450
In the first one, we are NASA,

44
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,424
and we have a model for detecting malfunctioning parts on a spaceship.

45
00:01:52,424 --> 00:01:55,469
In the second, we have a video recommender system,

46
00:01:55,469 --> 00:02:01,000
and we have a model for sending users phone notifications about new videos they may like.

47
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,870
And in the third one, we are a store,

48
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:06,760
and we have a model for sending free samples in the mail to potential clients.

49
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:10,830
And let's say one of them has an F beta score of F1,

50
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,020
the other one is F0.5,

51
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,825
and the other one is F2.

52
00:02:14,824 --> 00:02:16,009
Which one is which?

00:02:16,009 --> 00:02:19,349
