1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,129
So, here's our first trick that we will align

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:04,734
closer to a point that we're going to use in a linear regression.

3
00:00:04,735 --> 00:00:07,620
It's called the absolute trick and it works like this,

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:09,224
we start with a point,

5
00:00:09,224 --> 00:00:14,919
and a line, and the idea is that the point wants the line to come closer to it.

6
00:00:14,919 --> 00:00:16,949
So, let's put some numbers here,

7
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:19,379
the point has coordinates p comma q,

8
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:23,179
where p is a horizontal coordinate and q is the vertical coordinate.

9
00:00:23,179 --> 00:00:27,870
The line has equation y equals w_1x plus w_2.

10
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:32,215
In here w_1 is the slope and w_2 is the y-intercept.

11
00:00:32,215 --> 00:00:35,010
So, an easy way to move the line closer to the point

12
00:00:35,009 --> 00:00:37,649
pq is to just add one to the y-intercept,

13
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:39,649
and then there is, the line moves up.

14
00:00:39,649 --> 00:00:41,729
Now let's add something to the slope two to

15
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:43,909
make the line rotating the direction of the point.

16
00:00:43,909 --> 00:00:47,489
This is going to look a little strange but it's going to make sense very soon.

17
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:50,219
So, this distance over here is p because it's

18
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:53,409
the horizontal distance from the y-axis to the point.

19
00:00:53,409 --> 00:00:55,904
So let's just add that, let's add p to the slope,

20
00:00:55,905 --> 00:00:58,859
and now our new slope is w_1 plus p,

21
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,320
and that rotates the line in this direction.

22
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,939
Now our new equation is y equals w_1 plus p times x plus w_2 plus one,

23
00:01:07,939 --> 00:01:10,230
and that's pretty much what the absolute trick is about.

24
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:11,875
Notice some subtleties though,

25
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:13,980
notice that we moved the line a little too much,

26
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:16,650
and we actually went over the point and kept going,

27
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:18,420
we don't want this, in general in

28
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,480
machine learning we never want to take big steps like this.

29
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:24,475
Instead what we want to do is take tiny steps.

30
00:01:24,474 --> 00:01:26,849
So, in order to take a tiny step we'll just do

31
00:01:26,849 --> 00:01:31,004
the exact same thing we did except we multiply everything by a small number.

32
00:01:31,004 --> 00:01:34,875
So let's take a small number called the learning rate, let's say alpha,

33
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:39,340
and instead of adding one to the y-intercept and p to the slope,

34
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:43,710
we will add alpha times one to the y-intercept,

35
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:46,064
and alpha times p to the slope.

36
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:49,349
Now the line moves up by a little bit and rotates a little bit,

37
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:51,674
so we don't have that risk of going too far.

38
00:01:51,674 --> 00:01:58,424
Our new equation is going to be w_1 plus p times alpha times x plus w_2 plus alpha.

39
00:01:58,424 --> 00:02:03,625
So our new slope is w_1 plus p times alpha and our new y-intercept is w_2 plus alpha.

40
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:06,060
So we're doing better but there's still a little subtlety.

41
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:09,560
What happens if the point is not on top of the line but underneath the line?

42
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,590
Well, same thing except now instead of adding we just subtract to get

43
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:19,969
our new equation w_1 minus b times alpha times x plus w_2 minus alpha.

44
00:02:19,969 --> 00:02:24,419
The reason is if we subtract alpha to the y-intercept the line moves down instead of up

45
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:28,919
and if we subtract p times alpha to the slope the line rotates in this direction instead.

46
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:30,579
Something more interesting is this,

47
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,690
and that will explain the reason p is there.

48
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:36,509
If the point is not on the right of the y-axis but on the left of it,

49
00:02:36,509 --> 00:02:40,378
than we still add one to the y-intercept because we need the line to move up,

50
00:02:40,378 --> 00:02:43,289
but the fact that now we're adding p to the slope and p is now

51
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:47,004
a negative number means that our line now rotates in this direction,

52
00:02:47,004 --> 00:02:49,240
so that's a reason for p to be there.

53
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:52,280
Another reason for p to be there is this, check this out.

54
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:54,914
If this distance is small then p is small,

55
00:02:54,914 --> 00:02:57,504
so we're adding a small number to the slope.

56
00:02:57,504 --> 00:02:59,990
Now, if the distance is large then p is

57
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:02,240
large so we're adding a large number to the slope.

58
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,580
It makes sense that if the point is really

59
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,490
close to the y-axis we want to increase the slope by a little bit.

60
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:10,265
Whereas if it's far want to move it by a lot more.

61
00:03:10,264 --> 00:03:12,824
So, let's do an example to make this more clear.

62
00:03:12,824 --> 00:03:17,185
Let's say we have the point 5 comma 15 and the line y equals 2_x plus three,

63
00:03:17,185 --> 00:03:20,890
so this means the distance from the point to the y-axis is five,

64
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:23,875
now let's say our learning rate is 0.1.

65
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:26,699
So, we're adding 0.1 times one to

66
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:30,269
the y-intercept and that moves the line up by a little bit.

67
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:33,555
Also we are taking five multiplying it by 0.1

68
00:03:33,555 --> 00:03:36,935
and adding that to the slope which makes the line move in this direction,

69
00:03:36,935 --> 00:03:42,979
this means our new equation is y equals 2.5 x plus 3.1.

70
00:03:42,979 --> 00:03:45,599
Now, check out what happens if the point is in the left,

71
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,694
we're still adding 0.1 to the y-intercept to move the line up,

72
00:03:49,694 --> 00:03:53,025
but now to the slope we're going to add the product of

73
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:57,000
0.1 and minus five, that's minus 0.5.

74
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:03,199
This means our new equation is going to be 1.5 x plus 3.1.

75
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:05,349
As you can see the slope moved in

76
00:04:05,349 --> 00:04:08,159
a different direction which made it go closer to the point.

77
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,145
So that's it, that's the absolute trick,

78
00:04:10,145 --> 00:04:13,320
and we're going to use it extensively in linear regression.
