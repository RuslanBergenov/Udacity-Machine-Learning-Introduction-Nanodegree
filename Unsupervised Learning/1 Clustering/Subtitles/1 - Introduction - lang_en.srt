00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,560
Welcome to this course on unsupervised learning. I'm Josh.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,349
And I'm Jay.

3
00:00:04,349 --> 00:00:07,764
Were both really excited to be working with you through this course.

4
00:00:07,764 --> 00:00:11,169
Unsupervised learning is one of the three main branches of machine learning.

5
00:00:11,169 --> 00:00:13,115
In contrast to supervised learning,

6
00:00:13,115 --> 00:00:15,914
where you have a label or a value that you're trying to predict,

7
00:00:15,914 --> 00:00:18,299
in unsupervised learning, you are interested in

8
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:20,820
grouping data together that don't have labels.

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,254
In this course, you will learn some common techniques that are used for

10
00:00:24,254 --> 00:00:28,169
unsupervised learning as well as how to implement them using scikit-learn.

11
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,010
Jay and I both really enjoy teaching others about technology,

12
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:33,864
machine learning, and programming.

13
00:00:33,865 --> 00:00:36,990
So we're very excited to be joining you in this course.

14
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:38,640
Let's get started.
