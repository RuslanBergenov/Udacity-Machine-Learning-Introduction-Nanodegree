00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,064
Now, I'm going to leave you with a question.

2
00:00:02,064 --> 00:00:03,629
Here is the XOR perceptron,

3
00:00:03,629 --> 00:00:06,719
which is very similar to the other two except this one returns a true

4
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:10,335
if exactly one of them is true and the other one is false.

5
00:00:10,335 --> 00:00:12,380
So it returns this table.

6
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:16,199
Now, the question is can we turn this into a perceptron.

7
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,140
These four points seem hard to be separated by a line.

8
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,195
We'll see what we can do in the quiz.

9
00:00:22,195 --> 00:00:24,285
But in a nutshell the idea is the following.

10
00:00:24,285 --> 00:00:29,190
We'll be combining perception so that the output of one becomes the input of another one.

11
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:32,539
This is what forms a multi-layer perception or a neural network.

12
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:35,019
We'll elaborate on these later in the class.
