Hello. In the last section,

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,820
we learn regression in which our goal is to predict values.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,140
In the next few sections,

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,720
we'll focus on Classification Algorithms.

5
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:15,535
Classification Algorithms are those that answer questions that have answers, yes or no.

6
00:00:15,535 --> 00:00:18,910
For example, is this email spam or not?

7
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,665
Would this user download an app or not?

8
00:00:21,665 --> 00:00:23,910
Is this patient sick or not?

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:27,735
The first one of these algorithms I will learn is the Perception Algorithm.

10
00:00:27,735 --> 00:00:30,395
This algorithm is the basis for a neural networks,

11
00:00:30,395 --> 00:00:34,380
so you'll see a lot more of it in the Deep Learning section of this nano degree.

12
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,620
But for now, let's start by studying this algorithm in more...
