00:00:01,219 --> 00:00:07,330
If you're interested in

2
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:10,990
solving machine learning questions that fall into either supervised,

3
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:14,679
or unsupervised learning, the most popular open-source

4
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:18,855
library in the world for solving these problems is scikit-learn.

5
00:00:18,855 --> 00:00:23,289
Scikit-learn, provides any data scientist the ability to use

6
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:28,928
the most advanced techniques in supervised and unsupervised machine learning easily,

7
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:31,329
and for a variety of situations.

8
00:00:31,329 --> 00:00:34,629
You can expect that scikit-learn will continue to

9
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:37,695
be used for machine learning in both industry,

10
00:00:37,695 --> 00:00:40,835
and academia for the foreseeable future.

11
00:00:40,835 --> 00:00:42,579
In the following lessons,

12
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:47,489
you will get comfortable solving a range of problems using this library.
