Hi, and welcome to the small evaluation and validation section.

2
00:00:03,835 --> 00:00:06,839
My name is Luis Serrano and I'm an instructor here at Udacity.

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:09,705
In this section, we'll focus on two questions.

4
00:00:09,705 --> 00:00:11,039
The first question is,

5
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:13,479
how well is my model doing?

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,310
So, let's say we've trained our machine learning model and the question is,

7
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:17,894
is this model good or not?

8
00:00:17,894 --> 00:00:22,015
So, we're going to learn metrics to tell us if it is good or not.

9
00:00:22,015 --> 00:00:24,615
And the second question is, once we figure that out,

10
00:00:24,614 --> 00:00:26,894
how do we improve it based on these metrics?

11
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:29,594
Let's dive right in and learn to evaluate,

12
00:00:29,594 --> 00:00:32,000
validate, and improve our machine learning models.
