1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,095
Now, I want to apply the Naive Bayes algorithm.

2
00:00:03,095 --> 00:00:06,089
We want to calculate the probability that an email is

3
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:09,490
spam given that it contains the word easy and money.

4
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:12,294
As we briefly stated before, we'll make an assumption.

5
00:00:12,294 --> 00:00:17,039
We'll assume that the product of the probabilities that the email is

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,649
spam if it contains the word easy times the probability that it's spam.

7
00:00:21,649 --> 00:00:26,619
If it contains the word money is the desired probability.

8
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:31,030
This is a Naive assumption because it could be that these two are not independent.

9
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,390
Say it could be that emails containing the word

10
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:36,119
easy are more likely to contain the word money.

11
00:00:36,119 --> 00:00:39,049
But it turns out that this assumption ends up

12
00:00:39,049 --> 00:00:42,814
working really well in many situations, so we'll make it.

13
00:00:42,814 --> 00:00:46,789
So, we obtain that the probability of the email being

14
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:52,284
spam is one-half times two-thirds which is one-third.

15
00:00:52,284 --> 00:00:54,739
For clarity, written the actual formula for

16
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:58,770
these two calculations using Bayes theorem that we've done previously.

17
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:04,975
These two give us again 0.5 and 0.67 for the posteriors.

18
00:01:04,974 --> 00:01:08,469
So finally, we multiply them and obtain the probability of an email being

19
00:01:08,469 --> 00:01:13,814
spam given that it has the words easy and money is 0.33.

20
00:01:13,814 --> 00:01:15,984
In general, this is what happens.

21
00:01:15,984 --> 00:01:18,060
Let's say we have N suspicious words.

22
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,155
For example, easy, money, cheap, et cetera.

23
00:01:21,155 --> 00:01:23,009
These are our conditions,

24
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:25,944
and we get a new email we tested against them.

25
00:01:25,944 --> 00:01:30,219
So, we make the Naive assumption that the probability of spam given

26
00:01:30,219 --> 00:01:34,625
that the email contains all these words is the product of these probabilities.

27
00:01:34,625 --> 00:01:37,194
How do we calculate each one of them?

28
00:01:37,194 --> 00:01:40,269
Easy. Using Bayes theorem.
