1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,805
Well, let's see. A woman who works at an office.

2
00:00:02,805 --> 00:00:07,050
In the table, there's two women who work and both downloaded WhatsApp.

3
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:08,632
So, let's say, it's safe to assume that

4
00:00:08,632 --> 00:00:11,410
recommending WhatsApp to this new person is the best idea.

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,470
Now, for the man who works at a factory,

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:18,524
we'll see that there's another man in the table who works and he downloaded Snapchat.

7
00:00:18,524 --> 00:00:21,629
So, we'll proceed to recommend Snapchat to the new person.

8
00:00:21,629 --> 00:00:24,125
And finally, the girl that is in high school.

9
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:26,344
Well, we see that in the table,

10
00:00:26,344 --> 00:00:29,689
there are three students and they all downloaded Pokemon Go.

11
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:33,120
So, we'll go ahead and recommend Pokemon Go to this new person.

12
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,024
But now, that's how a human thinks.

13
00:00:35,024 --> 00:00:37,500
For the computer, it's harder to repeat this procedure.

14
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,820
However, the computer can ask

15
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:44,189
a slightly more technical question like this one: between gender and occupation,

16
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:48,734
which one seems more decisive for predicting what app will the users download?

17
00:00:48,734 --> 00:00:51,329
This question sounds slightly ambiguous, but if you think about it,

18
00:00:51,329 --> 00:00:54,000
the answer does make sense. Let's give it a try.
