1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,940
If you've been following

2
00:00:06,940 --> 00:00:10,630
the headlines related to artificial intelligence and machine learning,

3
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,260
you probably have heard of deep learning.

4
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:15,070
Deep learning has beaten

5
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:19,524
essentially all other machine-learning algorithms in its ability to predict,

6
00:00:19,524 --> 00:00:22,534
and it can actually be used for supervised,

7
00:00:22,535 --> 00:00:25,734
unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.

8
00:00:25,734 --> 00:00:27,673
From a historical perspective,

9
00:00:27,673 --> 00:00:30,579
the growth of this technique makes a lot of sense.

10
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:35,349
Over time, we've cared less and less about how we make predictions,

11
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,620
and now we care more about the accuracy of our predictions.

12
00:00:38,619 --> 00:00:42,979
This connects well to the advancement of deep learning where we rarely

13
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:48,254
understand all of how or why our model make certain predictions.

14
00:00:48,255 --> 00:00:53,145
Unfortunately, deep learning is not the solution to every problem.

15
00:00:53,145 --> 00:00:56,225
It has three major barriers to entry.

16
00:00:56,225 --> 00:00:59,480
First, you must have enough data.

17
00:00:59,479 --> 00:01:02,774
Deep learning requires a lot of data.

18
00:01:02,774 --> 00:01:06,019
Second, you must have the computing power.

19
00:01:06,019 --> 00:01:10,459
In order to reach superhuman performance in the game of Go,

20
00:01:10,459 --> 00:01:18,514
Google's DeepMind AlphaGo required 1,202 CPUs and 176 GPUs.

21
00:01:18,515 --> 00:01:24,265
Third, you probably won't understand why certain decisions were being made,

22
00:01:24,265 --> 00:01:27,939
given the complexity and flexibility of these algorithms.

23
00:01:27,939 --> 00:01:30,299
For these reasons, not every

24
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,869
application of machine learning is one that requires deep learning.

25
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:37,655
You'll be getting some practice using deep learning in this program.

26
00:01:37,655 --> 00:01:42,599
However, we have an entire deep learning nanodegree program available on the subject.

27
00:01:42,599 --> 00:01:46,489
So, it's not the primary focus of this program.
