00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,280
So let's go back to our two examples: a medical model and spam e-mail model.

2
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:06,200
Recall that for the medical model,

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,050
we have four possibilities: a true

4
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:13,725
positive which is when the patient is sick and we correctly diagnosed him as sick;

5
00:00:13,724 --> 00:00:16,710
a true negative which is when the patient is not

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,785
sick and we correctly diagnose them as not sick;

7
00:00:19,785 --> 00:00:22,324
a false positive which is when the patient is healthy

8
00:00:22,324 --> 00:00:24,814
and we incorrectly diagnose them as sick;

9
00:00:24,815 --> 00:00:27,450
and finally a false negative which is when the patient is

10
00:00:27,449 --> 00:00:30,285
sick and we incorrectly diagnose them as healthy.

11
00:00:30,285 --> 00:00:34,390
Now, let's forget about the two correct ones and focus only on the mistakes.

12
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:36,179
Below, we'll have a quiz.

13
00:00:36,179 --> 00:00:38,039
Which one do you think is worse,

14
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:40,710
a false positive or a false negative?

15
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:43,410
In other words, what is the worst mistake,

16
00:00:43,409 --> 00:00:47,129
to misdiagnose a healthy patient as sick or a sick patient as healthy?

17
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,590
Now, let's go back to our other model,

18
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:50,805
the spam e-mail model.

19
00:00:50,804 --> 00:00:53,939
So we have two e-mails: one non-spam from our grandma telling us

20
00:00:53,939 --> 00:00:57,349
she baked cookies and one spam from a questionable source.

21
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,995
Recall that for this model,

22
00:00:58,994 --> 00:01:01,994
we again have four possibilities: a true positive

23
00:01:01,994 --> 00:01:05,399
which is when the spam e-mail gets correctly sent into the spam folder;

24
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,650
a true negative which is when our grandma's e-mail

25
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,960
gets correctly sent to the inbox folder;

26
00:01:09,959 --> 00:01:14,324
a false positive which grandma's e-mail accidentally gets sent to the spam folder;

27
00:01:14,325 --> 00:01:16,079
and finally a false negative which is when

28
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:18,879
a spam e-mail accidentally gets sent to our inbox.

29
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:23,009
Now, again, let's forget about the two correct ones and focus only on the mistakes.

30
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,915
So below, there will be another quiz.

31
00:01:24,915 --> 00:01:26,670
Which one do you think is worse,

32
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:29,189
a false positive or a false negative?

33
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,469
In other words, what is a worse mistake,

34
00:01:31,469 --> 00:01:33,450
to accidentally send your grandma's email to

35
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,980
the spam folder or to accidentally send the spam email into your inbox?

36
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,660
Enter your answers below.
