1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,370
Well, let's remember that accuracy is a ratio between

2
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:06,340
the correctly classified points and the total number of points.

3
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:09,030
We notice that there are six points correctly classified as

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,310
positive and five correctly classified as negative.

5
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:15,420
These add to 11 correctly classified points.

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,385
Since the total number of points is 14,

7
00:00:18,385 --> 00:00:22,815
we conclude that the answer is equal to 11 divided by 14,

8
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:26,140
which gives an answer of 78.57
