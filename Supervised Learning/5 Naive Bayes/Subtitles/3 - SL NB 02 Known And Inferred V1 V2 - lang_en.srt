00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,609
In the last video, we saw an example of Bayes theorem.

2
00:00:02,609 --> 00:00:06,334
But here's the main idea fit and it's a very powerful theorem.

3
00:00:06,334 --> 00:00:11,835
What it does is it switches from what we know to what we infer.

4
00:00:11,835 --> 00:00:14,850
What we know in this case is the probability that Alex

5
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:18,434
wears red and the probability that Brenda wears red.

6
00:00:18,434 --> 00:00:20,369
And what we infer is the opposite,

7
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:22,575
is the probability that someone wearing red is

8
00:00:22,574 --> 00:00:25,724
Alex or that someone wearing red is Brenda.

9
00:00:25,725 --> 00:00:29,700
In other words, initially we know the probability of an event A.

10
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:31,408
And to give us more information,

11
00:00:31,408 --> 00:00:35,265
we introduce a new event R which is related to A.

12
00:00:35,265 --> 00:00:37,770
We know the probability of R given A.

13
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,290
What Bayes' theorem does is from these two,

14
00:00:40,289 --> 00:00:44,039
it infers the probability of A given R. This

15
00:00:44,039 --> 00:00:49,530
is the new probability of A once we know that the event R has occurred
