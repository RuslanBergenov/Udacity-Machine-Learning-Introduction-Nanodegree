Hello. My name is Matt,

2
00:00:01,665 --> 00:00:03,900
a Content Developer here at Udacity.

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:08,115
I wanted to take a few minutes to talk with you about LinkedIn and networking.

4
00:00:08,115 --> 00:00:10,830
Networking is an essential and effective way to meet

5
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:13,860
and keep in touch with other people who share your interests.

6
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,570
Whether you're connecting with thought leaders in

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:17,955
your career field or being a mentor to others,

8
00:00:17,955 --> 00:00:20,820
networking has the ability to raise your visibility to

9
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:25,260
job recruiters and others looking to use your skills collaboratively.

10
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,000
You may be actively working toward a promotion or you're looking for your first job.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,760
Some of you may also be trying to change into

12
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,940
career paths and break into a completely new industry.

13
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,070
Wherever you may be in your career path,

14
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,235
networking is the key to getting a great job that will fulfill you,

15
00:00:42,235 --> 00:00:47,295
be more challenging, pay more or meet whatever your goals may be.

16
00:00:47,295 --> 00:00:51,470
We all know the importance of the resume in finding a new job and how

17
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:55,885
crucial the first impression is to presenting yourself to interviewers and recruiters.

18
00:00:55,885 --> 00:00:59,950
LinkedIn provides a solution to both of these issues and more.

19
00:00:59,950 --> 00:01:01,370
LinkedIn has become one of

20
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:05,400
the most important tools you need to have when looking for a new job,

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,885
expanding your network, helping people,

22
00:01:08,885 --> 00:01:13,725
discovering more events or heightening your brand and presence in the industry.

23
00:01:13,725 --> 00:01:15,200
When it comes to networking,

24
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,040
you may have gotten advice to grow your network,

25
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,625
but may not know the strategies to do so.

26
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:24,800
This lesson is about giving you that missing strategy so that you can

27
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,700
expand your LinkedIn profile to help you in your networking goals.

28
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,100
Back when I was looking for a new career before Udacity,

29
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:35,030
I resisted the idea of using my LinkedIn account during the job search.

30
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:39,120
Connecting with people I didn't know was really awkward and frustrating.

31
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:43,160
I thought that my time and energy would be better spent making sure my resume was

32
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:47,925
perfect or that I was ready for those interviews that would one day I had my way.

33
00:01:47,925 --> 00:01:51,755
Investing time into LinkedIn seem like a huge burden.

34
00:01:51,755 --> 00:01:54,945
However, I learned later that using LinkedIn

35
00:01:54,945 --> 00:01:58,740
actually has a benefit of connecting me with peers and sharing knowledge,

36
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:03,440
helping me keep up to date on changes and innovation within my career field and opens

37
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:08,640
me up to many career opportunities not available from other sources like job boards.
