1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,174
In terms of applications,

2
00:00:02,174 --> 00:00:06,569
ICA is widely used in medical scanners and so this is

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:11,400
an example of a type of brain scan called the EEG or MEG,

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,589
where each of these sensors detects electric signals or in a similar test,

5
00:00:17,589 --> 00:00:19,829
magnetic signals inside the brain.

6
00:00:19,829 --> 00:00:25,259
So, each of these is a electric sensor and each of them would produce these readings,

7
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,850
that are all mixtures of things happening inside the brain,

8
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:37,195
and so ICA can be used where these are the initial or actual readings of this data.

9
00:00:37,195 --> 00:00:40,715
ICA is an algorithm that's able to look at them and then

10
00:00:40,715 --> 00:00:44,329
find the independent components inside the brain that generated

11
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:46,655
these readings that are mixed here because

12
00:00:46,655 --> 00:00:49,609
an electric signal will be generated in one part of

13
00:00:49,609 --> 00:00:52,820
the brain bound to be hard to tell because you

14
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:57,545
have the skull separating the sensors from the actual places.

15
00:00:57,545 --> 00:01:01,035
So, ICA is widely used in scenarios like this.

16
00:01:01,034 --> 00:01:05,935
It's also used in FMRIs in the same way for a lot of brain scans.

17
00:01:05,935 --> 00:01:08,780
So, these are the independent components and it can

18
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:12,094
isolates where certain signals came from in the brain.

19
00:01:12,094 --> 00:01:16,760
There have been attempts at using ICA for financial data.

20
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,520
I don't know that this is a very popular thing to do,

21
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:21,804
but it's just interesting to look at, I guess.

22
00:01:21,805 --> 00:01:28,625
So, this is one paper that tries to apply ICA to a factor model in finance, let's say.

23
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:33,590
So, this data is stocks signals and

24
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:38,390
it tries to isolate what caused the stocks to go up and down,

25
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,820
what components are there and most of

26
00:01:40,819 --> 00:01:44,750
these papers they're trying to do ICA in finance they, something like this,

27
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,034
the economy is a very complex system,

28
00:01:47,034 --> 00:01:51,769
and so, they rarely would come up with things that are of real value.

29
00:01:51,769 --> 00:01:54,959
This could be interesting to look at, I guess.

30
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:58,519
There's another one looking at financial data as well,

31
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:04,349
and so this is a dataset of five stores and this is the cash flow of them.

32
00:02:04,349 --> 00:02:06,875
So, this is a retail chain of some sort.

33
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:11,780
So, this is the cash flow over 140 weeks.

34
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:15,000
So, you see spikes and go up and they go down.

35
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,379
To make it a little bit more clear, let's break it down.

36
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:19,289
So, this is the first year,

37
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:21,259
this is the second year,

38
00:02:21,259 --> 00:02:24,524
and this is a part of the third year that is available.

39
00:02:24,525 --> 00:02:29,420
So, you can see dip here our spike and then a dip.

40
00:02:29,419 --> 00:02:32,655
This is about Christmas time, I guess.

41
00:02:32,655 --> 00:02:34,740
So, if we do, I say to this,

42
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,430
we get these four components.

43
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:42,730
They would give some indication of things that are happening.

44
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:46,739
So, this first component captures this dries,

45
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:49,439
the spike and dip in Christmas, for example.

46
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:54,204
In this fourth one captures during the summer month,

47
00:02:54,205 --> 00:02:56,770
there seems to be a bit of a slump here.

48
00:02:56,770 --> 00:03:00,635
So, this is another thing that I thought is interesting to look at.

49
00:03:00,634 --> 00:03:05,419
There aren't on lot of papers or applications of using ICA in financial data,

50
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:09,599
but it could be intriguing and these papers are linked in the text below.
