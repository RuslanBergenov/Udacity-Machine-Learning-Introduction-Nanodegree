1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:06,750
Consider this dataset.

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,970
On the x-axis is the amount of time in minutes it

3
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:13,750
takes to run five kilometers for 100 individuals.

4
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:21,320
On the y-axis is each individual score on a standardized test on a scale from 200 to 800.

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,079
Notice that this provides two clusters,

6
00:00:24,079 --> 00:00:28,375
one exists up here at the top for those with higher test scores,

7
00:00:28,375 --> 00:00:31,925
and another exists here for those with lower test scores.

8
00:00:31,925 --> 00:00:37,219
However, let's say we change the x-axis to represent seconds instead,

9
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:40,524
and the y-axis to represent test scores.

10
00:00:40,524 --> 00:00:42,810
Then we have two different clusters,

11
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:45,210
one for those with faster running times,

12
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,155
and another set for those with slower running times.

13
00:00:48,155 --> 00:00:51,450
When using minutes, the computed distance between

14
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:54,840
individuals is smaller than when using seconds.

15
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,859
Similarly, we have larger distances between individuals when

16
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:03,090
using lower test scores rather than standardized test scores.

17
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:05,340
This is just one example of how

18
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:09,320
feature scaling might change the final clusters determined by a model.

19
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:14,639
For this reason, it's important to standardize your data before clustering.
