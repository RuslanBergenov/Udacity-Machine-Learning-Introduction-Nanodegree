00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,650
The implementation of random prediction in Scikit-learn is pretty straightforward.

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:10,565
So, we just import the library here and then we declare it.

3
00:00:10,564 --> 00:00:13,129
Sparse random projection is the faster.

4
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:14,770
So, there is a Gaussian random projection,

5
00:00:14,769 --> 00:00:16,660
there's sparse random projection.

6
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,719
This is a little bit more performant,

7
00:00:18,719 --> 00:00:20,594
and then we fit transform,

8
00:00:20,594 --> 00:00:24,344
pass it our data set, and then we get the new transformed dataset.

9
00:00:24,344 --> 00:00:29,309
So, here if we want to declare or specify a specific value for Epsilon,

10
00:00:29,309 --> 00:00:34,659
we pass it here, or if we want to force it into a specific size or number of components.

11
00:00:34,659 --> 00:00:36,519
If we don't specify anything,

12
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,180
the number of components is automatic and it's calculated by using Epsilon,

13
00:00:41,179 --> 00:00:44,170
and by using the number of points or samples in the dataset.

14
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:47,530
So, it will choose based on the dataset.
