1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,830
So, let's do some math.

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:05,290
Let's assign to each data point an initial weight of one.

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:07,290
Now, let's fit our first Learner.

4
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,455
Before we wanted to minimize the number of errors.

5
00:00:10,455 --> 00:00:13,199
Now we want to minimize the sum of weights of

6
00:00:13,199 --> 00:00:17,660
the incorrectly classified points which as of now is the same.

7
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,350
So, here is the model.

8
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,675
If we add the weights of the correctly classified points,

9
00:00:22,675 --> 00:00:26,859
we get a seven and three for the incorrectly classified points.

10
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:30,405
So, let's weigh the incorrectly classified points a bit more.

11
00:00:30,405 --> 00:00:35,914
How much? Well, let's make it enough to have this model be a 50-50 model.

12
00:00:35,914 --> 00:00:41,490
So, if we take these three points and weight them by a factor of 7/3 three or 2.33,

13
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:44,469
that our model now has seven as the sum of the weights of

14
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:47,049
the correctly classified points and also

15
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:50,684
seven as the sum of the weights of the incorrectly classified points.

16
00:00:50,685 --> 00:00:54,060
So, this model now is lame, and we need a second one.

17
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:58,910
Our second model will be this one which fits the newly weighted data best.

18
00:00:58,909 --> 00:01:03,640
For this one, we can see that if we add the weights of the correctly classified points,

19
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,125
we get 11 and for the incorrectly classified ones we get three again.

20
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:10,715
So, let's weigh the incorrectly classified points.

21
00:01:10,715 --> 00:01:15,225
By how much? Well, enough to make this model a 50-50 model again.

22
00:01:15,224 --> 00:01:21,214
Notice that if we weighed this three errors each one by a factor of 11/3 or 3.66,

23
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:26,000
now the sum of the weights of the incorrectly classified points is 11.

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,265
So, our model is just a 50-50 model again. That's lame.

25
00:01:30,265 --> 00:01:33,825
Let's fit a third model in this newly weighted data.

26
00:01:33,825 --> 00:01:35,939
Here is our third model.

27
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:39,375
Now, what is the added weight of the correctly classified points.

28
00:01:39,375 --> 00:01:42,849
Now it's 19 and still three for the incorrect ones.

29
00:01:42,849 --> 00:01:45,609
We can keep this going, but let's stop.

30
00:01:45,609 --> 00:01:51,859
We have built three models and here are the three models or weak learners that we built.

31
00:01:51,859 --> 00:01:55,400
In the next video, we will learn how to combine them.
