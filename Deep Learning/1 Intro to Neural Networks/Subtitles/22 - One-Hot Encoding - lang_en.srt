1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,754
So, as we've seen so far,

2
00:00:01,754 --> 00:00:03,674
all our algorithms are numerical.

3
00:00:03,674 --> 00:00:05,807
This means we need to input numbers,

4
00:00:05,807 --> 00:00:08,640
such as a score in a test or the grades,

5
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,600
but the input data will not always look like numbers.

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:14,184
Sometimes it looks like this.

7
00:00:14,185 --> 00:00:15,925
Let's say the module receives as an input

8
00:00:15,925 --> 00:00:18,640
the fact that you got a gift or didn't get a gift.

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,719
How do we turn that into numbers? Well, that's easy.

10
00:00:21,719 --> 00:00:24,994
If you've got a gift, we'll just say that the input variable is 1.

11
00:00:24,995 --> 00:00:26,144
And, if you didn't get a gift,

12
00:00:26,144 --> 00:00:29,085
we'll just say that the input variable is 0.

13
00:00:29,085 --> 00:00:31,350
But, what if we have more classes as before or,

14
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:34,515
let's say, our classes are Duck, Beaver and Walrus?

15
00:00:34,515 --> 00:00:37,649
What variable do we input in the algorithm?

16
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:39,530
Maybe, we can input a 0 or 1 and a 2,

17
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:42,120
but that would not work because it would assume dependencies between

18
00:00:42,119 --> 00:00:45,287
the classes that we can't have. So, this is what we do.

19
00:00:45,287 --> 00:00:48,954
What we do is, we come up with one variable for each of the classes.

20
00:00:48,954 --> 00:00:50,739
So, our table becomes like this.

21
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,274
That's one variable for Duck,

22
00:00:52,274 --> 00:00:55,164
one for Beaver and one for Walrus.

23
00:00:55,164 --> 00:00:58,109
And, each one has its corresponding column.

24
00:00:58,109 --> 00:01:01,509
Now, if the input is a duck then the variable for duck is

25
00:01:01,509 --> 00:01:06,780
1 and the variables for beaver and walrus are 0.

26
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,775
Similarly for the beaver and the walrus.

27
00:01:09,775 --> 00:01:14,770
We may have more columns of data but at least there are no unnecessary dependencies.

28
00:01:14,769 --> 00:01:16,834
This process is called The One-Hot Encoding

29
00:01:16,834 --> 00:01:19,099
and it will be used a lot for processing data.
