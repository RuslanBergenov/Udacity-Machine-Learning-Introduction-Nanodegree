1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,250
Now, we have learned precision and recall.

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,859
So, as we've seen, our medical model has a precision of

3
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:09,315
55.7 percent and a recall of 83.3 percent.

4
00:00:09,314 --> 00:00:11,339
It's supposed to be a high recall model.

5
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:16,449
And our spam detector has a precision of 76.9 percent and a recall of 37 percent,

6
00:00:16,449 --> 00:00:18,894
and is supposed to be a high precision model.

7
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:22,829
Now, the question is, do we want to be carrying two numbers around all the time?

8
00:00:22,829 --> 00:00:26,189
Do we want to carry precision in one pocket and recall in the other one?

9
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:28,910
And I will be looking at both any time we make a decision.

10
00:00:28,910 --> 00:00:33,750
Well, that's inconvenient. We kind of want to only have one score.

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:38,325
So the question is, how do we combine these two scores into one?

12
00:00:38,325 --> 00:00:43,170
Can we think of a way? Well, a pretty simple ways taking the average.

13
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:45,495
So let's take the average of precision and recall.

14
00:00:45,494 --> 00:00:48,030
In the left, we get 69.5 percent.

15
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:51,060
Then in the right, we get 56.95 percent.

16
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,560
And that's an okay metric.

17
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,490
But I'm sure you're probably thinking in your head,

18
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,609
that's not very different than accuracy.

19
00:00:56,609 --> 00:00:58,365
That's not saying too much.

20
00:00:58,365 --> 00:01:00,300
And the way to see how this average is not

21
00:01:00,299 --> 00:01:02,554
the best idea is to try it in the extreme example.

22
00:01:02,554 --> 00:01:04,439
So the credit card fraud example.

23
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:07,649
So, again, we have a bunch of good and fraudulent credit card transactions.

24
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,100
Now let's pick a terrible model one which says,

25
00:01:10,099 --> 00:01:11,859
"All transactions are good."

26
00:01:11,859 --> 00:01:13,920
So what is the precision of this model?

27
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,040
Well, the precision is, out of the ones we classified as bad,

28
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,705
how many of them are bad?

29
00:01:18,704 --> 00:01:22,079
That's a question about number because we didn't label anything as fraudulent.

30
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:24,629
So it's kind of zero divided by zero, which is undefined.

31
00:01:24,629 --> 00:01:26,414
But it makes sense to think of it as

32
00:01:26,415 --> 00:01:31,485
100 percent since we made zero mistakes among the ones who predicted positive,

33
00:01:31,484 --> 00:01:33,795
which is what precision tries to measure.

34
00:01:33,795 --> 00:01:36,210
So let's say this model has 100 percent precision.

35
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:38,699
Now, as for the recall, the recall is,

36
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,730
how many of the fraudulent transactions did we catch?

37
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,545
Well, since we caught none,

38
00:01:43,545 --> 00:01:45,030
this number is zero.

39
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,010
So the average between precision and recall is

40
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:50,880
50 percent since it's the average of 100 and zero.

41
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:55,094
Now the question is, do I want to give this horrendous model of 50 percent?

42
00:01:55,094 --> 00:01:58,094
It seems like a really high score for such a lousy model.

43
00:01:58,094 --> 00:02:01,019
I kind of want to give it a much lower score, perhaps even zero.

44
00:02:01,019 --> 00:02:04,069
For average is not that good. Now let's try the opposite.

45
00:02:04,069 --> 00:02:07,500
And let's try the model that says that all transactions are fraudulent.

46
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,735
What is the precision of this model?

47
00:02:09,735 --> 00:02:12,795
Well, out of all the transactions that I said are fraudulent,

48
00:02:12,794 --> 00:02:15,479
472 were actually fraudulent.

49
00:02:15,479 --> 00:02:20,669
So, the precision is 472 divided by 284,807,

50
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:22,634
which is 0.16 percent.

51
00:02:22,634 --> 00:02:24,489
And the recall is actually pretty good,

52
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:28,875
because out of the 472 fraudulent transactions, I caught all of them.

53
00:02:28,875 --> 00:02:33,689
So the recall is 472 divided by 472, which is 100 percent.

54
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:39,419
So, again, the average of the two is the average of 0.16 and 100, which is 50.08.

55
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:41,909
Again, a very high score for a really lousy model.

56
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:44,789
So we want to give it a lower score or maybe something close to zero.

57
00:02:44,789 --> 00:02:47,769
So, in summary, average is not the greatest thing

58
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:51,060
in principle if either precision or recall is very low.

59
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:54,449
We want the number to be low even if the other one is high.

60
00:02:54,449 --> 00:02:56,280
So, here's a solution.

61
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,504
There's another type of average called the harmonic mean,

62
00:02:59,504 --> 00:03:00,990
and it works as follows.

63
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,265
Let's say we have two numbers,

64
00:03:02,264 --> 00:03:05,039
X and Y. X is smaller than Y.

65
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:08,009
And we have their arithmetic mean over here.

66
00:03:08,009 --> 00:03:09,780
That is the average,

67
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,460
X plus Y divided by two.

68
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,670
And we have something called the harmonic mean which is defined

69
00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:18,329
by 2XY divided by X plus Y.

70
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:21,330
And it's kind of an average two in the sense that if the two numbers are equal,

71
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,009
we get X or Y,

72
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,409
and it always lies between X and Y.

73
00:03:25,409 --> 00:03:27,329
But actually, it's a mathematical fact that

74
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:30,930
the harmonic mean is always less than the arithmetic mean.

75
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,905
So it's closer to the smaller number than to the higher number.

76
00:03:34,905 --> 00:03:38,370
So let's look at an example. If the precision is one and the recall is zero,

77
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:40,439
the average is 0.5,

78
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:41,865
but the harmonic mean is,

79
00:03:41,865 --> 00:03:44,189
if we plug in the formula, zero.

80
00:03:44,189 --> 00:03:48,750
Another example, if the precision is 0.2 and the recall is 0.8,

81
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,389
then the arithmetic mean is 0.5,

82
00:03:50,389 --> 00:03:52,844
but the harmonic mean is 0.32.

83
00:03:52,844 --> 00:03:54,990
So it's closer to the lower number.

84
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:58,439
So, from now on, we will not be using the average or arithmetic mean,

85
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:00,210
but we'll be using the harmonic mean,

86
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:03,060
and that's going to be called F1 score.

87
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,314
And as we said, the F1 score is closer to the smallest,

88
00:04:06,314 --> 00:04:08,030
between precision and recall.

89
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:10,185
So if one of them is particularly low,

90
00:04:10,185 --> 00:04:12,990
the F1 score kind of raises a flag.

91
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:15,000
The average kind of says, "If one is good,

92
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,019
but the other one is bad,

93
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:17,414
then the average is okay."

94
00:04:17,415 --> 00:04:21,015
But the F1 score raises the flag if one of them is small.

95
00:04:21,014 --> 00:04:24,870
So we can now go back to the credit card fraud example and calculate the F1 score.

96
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:27,870
Since is going to be the harmonic mean between the precision,

97
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:29,129
which is 100 percent,

98
00:04:29,129 --> 00:04:30,779
and the recall, which is zero,

99
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:34,724
we can plug in the formula and actually get an F1 score of zero.

100
00:04:34,725 --> 00:04:37,020
This is much closer to what the models should score.

101
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:38,909
So, in the following two quizzes,

102
00:04:38,910 --> 00:04:43,730
we'll let you calculate the F1 score of the medical model and the spam email model.
