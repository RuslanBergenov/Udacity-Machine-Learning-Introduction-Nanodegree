1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,984
Independent component analysis is

2
00:00:02,984 --> 00:00:06,929
a method similar to PCA and random projection and that it

3
00:00:06,929 --> 00:00:11,449
takes a set of features and produces a different set that is useful in some way.

4
00:00:11,449 --> 00:00:15,989
But it's different in that PCA works to maximize variance,

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,490
ICA assumes that the features are mixtures of independent sources and it

6
00:00:20,489 --> 00:00:25,289
tries to isolate these independent sources that are mixed in this dataset.

7
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:29,564
The classic example used to explain ICA is something called the cocktail party problem.

8
00:00:29,565 --> 00:00:32,140
Let's look at a variation of this problem.

9
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:37,765
So, let's say that three of your friends go to an art show and there are three curtains.

10
00:00:37,765 --> 00:00:42,679
One of them opens up and there's a person playing a piano there.

11
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:45,204
They play a nice tune on the piano,

12
00:00:45,204 --> 00:00:48,920
you're in there to listen to it so you assume that it sounded good.

13
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:51,350
Then after a little bit of time

14
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:55,185
another curtain is uncovered and there is a person playing the cello.

15
00:00:55,185 --> 00:00:57,880
The piano is still playing and then cello starts

16
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:00,175
playing but they're playing two different pieces.

17
00:01:00,174 --> 00:01:02,269
They don't really work together.

18
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,310
There's sort of mixing together, and then,

19
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:09,320
the third curtain is opened and then there's a TV turned

20
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:14,314
on and there's this sign wave noise coming in.

21
00:01:14,314 --> 00:01:16,149
It's a little bit of a mess.

22
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,810
So, here your friends decide that "Okay.

23
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:23,030
This is kind of interesting. Let's take our phones out and record this."

24
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:26,995
So, they record let's say six seconds of audio for this.

25
00:01:26,995 --> 00:01:32,265
This friend was closer to the piano so they have more piano and they're recording,

26
00:01:32,265 --> 00:01:35,125
this person was closer to the TV so they had more TV.

27
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:38,629
You have these three recordings and then each of them has

28
00:01:38,629 --> 00:01:42,199
a different level of the original source which you don't have.

29
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,000
You don't have these recordings.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,040
The first one sounds like this,

31
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:57,530
where the TV noise is a little faint and you can hear the piano and then the cello.

32
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,810
The second one there's a little bit more cello,

33
00:02:05,109 --> 00:02:12,240
and the TV got louder and the third one we can even see it here that the TV is little.

34
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:20,879
So, if you have only these three recordings,

35
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,060
is there a way for you to retrieve the original signals?,

36
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,675
Datasets? The answer is yes.

37
00:02:26,675 --> 00:02:31,385
That's what an example of what independent component analysis allows you to do.

38
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:35,269
I see A takes these three samples

39
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:38,450
or this dataset of sort of three dimensions and we tell it "All right,

40
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:41,294
there are three original components that were in there.

41
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:43,474
Can you find them in here?"

42
00:02:43,474 --> 00:02:51,509
It would output piano.

43
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:53,454
When it's able to work,

44
00:02:53,455 --> 00:02:56,315
it is able to isolate them and then the second output would

45
00:02:56,314 --> 00:03:06,090
be the cello and then the TV.

46
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,795
So, this is a type of problem called the blind

47
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:19,639
source separation and that's the problem that ICA solves.
