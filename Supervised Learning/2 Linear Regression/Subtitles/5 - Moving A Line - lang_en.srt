00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,469
So, let's have a little refresher on how we move lines by changing the parameters.

2
00:00:04,469 --> 00:00:08,519
So, if we have a line of equation y equals w_1x plus w_2,

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,009
where w_1 and w_2 are constants,

4
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:14,279
it looks like this, w_1 is the slope and

5
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:18,674
w_2 is the y-intercept which is where the line intersects the y-axis.

6
00:00:18,675 --> 00:00:21,795
Now, what happens if we increase w_1?

7
00:00:21,795 --> 00:00:25,600
Well, we increase the slope so that means the line rotates like this.

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,210
If we decrease w_1,

9
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,070
then we're decreasing the slope so the line rotates like this.

10
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:33,774
Now, what happens if we increase the y-intercept w_2?

11
00:00:33,774 --> 00:00:36,979
Then the line moves in a parallel way up like this.

12
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:38,714
And if we decrease w_2,

13
00:00:38,715 --> 00:00:40,975
then the line moves like that to the bottom.

14
00:00:40,975 --> 00:00:43,520
That's really all we're going to need for the tricks that are coming.
