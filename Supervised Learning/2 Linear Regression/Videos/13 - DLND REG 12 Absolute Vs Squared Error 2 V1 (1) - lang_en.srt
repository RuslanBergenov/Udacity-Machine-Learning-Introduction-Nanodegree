1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,565
Well that was a tricky quiz.

2
00:00:01,565 --> 00:00:02,685
If you said the same,

3
00:00:02,685 --> 00:00:04,620
then you were correct because as you can see,

4
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,714
moving this line up and down actually keeps the mean absolute error the same.

5
00:00:08,714 --> 00:00:11,250
You can convince yourself by looking at the picture and

6
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:13,570
checking that as you move a line up and down,

7
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:16,379
you're adding a segment to two of the errors and

8
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,899
removing a segment of equal length to the other two errors.

9
00:00:19,899 --> 00:00:22,969
Now, let's repeat the quiz but with the mean squared error.

10
00:00:22,969 --> 00:00:25,529
The question is, which one of these three lines A,

11
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,490
B, and C would give us a smaller mean squared error?

12
00:00:28,489 --> 00:00:30,399
Enter your answer below.
