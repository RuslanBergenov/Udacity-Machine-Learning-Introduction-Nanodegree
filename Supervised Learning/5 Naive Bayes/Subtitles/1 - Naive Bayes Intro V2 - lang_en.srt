Hello again and welcome to the Naive Bayes section.

2
00:00:03,265 --> 00:00:06,030
Naive Bayes is a more probabilistic algorithm which is based

3
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:09,096
on playing with the concept of conditional probability.

4
00:00:09,096 --> 00:00:13,305
This algorithm has great benefits such as being easy to implement and very fast to train.

5
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:17,655
We'll be studying one of very interesting applications, natural language processing.

6
00:00:17,655 --> 00:00:19,080
In the lectures and in the lab,

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,460
we'll use it to analyze text,

8
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,440
and emails, and speeches.
