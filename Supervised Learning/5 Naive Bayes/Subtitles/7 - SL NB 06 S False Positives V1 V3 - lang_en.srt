1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,270
Well, let's see. Let's use Bayes theorem to calculate it.

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:05,285
We'll use the following notation,

3
00:00:05,285 --> 00:00:07,129
S will stand for sick,

4
00:00:07,129 --> 00:00:09,025
H will stand for healthy,

5
00:00:09,025 --> 00:00:12,290
and the plus sign will stand for testing positive.

6
00:00:12,289 --> 00:00:15,474
So since one out of every 10,000 people are sick,

7
00:00:15,474 --> 00:00:20,050
we get that P of S is 0.0001.

8
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:24,365
Similarly, P of H is 0.9999.

9
00:00:24,364 --> 00:00:27,209
Since the test has 99 percent accuracy,

10
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,315
both for sick and for healthy patients,

11
00:00:29,315 --> 00:00:32,990
we see that P of plus,

12
00:00:32,990 --> 00:00:36,650
given S is 0.99,

13
00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:41,100
the probability that the sick patient will get correctly diagnosed.

14
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:46,020
And that P of plus given H is 0.01,

15
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:50,710
the probability that the healthy patient will get incorrectly diagnosed as sick.

16
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,509
So plugging that into the new formula,

17
00:00:52,509 --> 00:00:59,359
we get the probability of being diagnosed as positive when you're sick is exactly 0.0098,

18
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,125
which is less than 1 percent.

19
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:04,180
Really? Less than 1 percent?

20
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,730
When the test has 99 percent accuracy?

21
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:09,760
That's strange, but I guess that's the answer to the quiz.

22
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:14,035
So, less than 1 percent falls in this category of 0 to 20 percent.

23
00:01:14,034 --> 00:01:16,709
I'm still puzzled though, why less than 1 percent If

24
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:19,754
the test is correct 99 percent of the time.

25
00:01:19,754 --> 00:01:23,155
Well, let's explore. Let's go back to the tree of possibilities.

26
00:01:23,155 --> 00:01:25,905
Let's say we start with 1 million patients,

27
00:01:25,905 --> 00:01:28,715
and they have two options, healthy and sick.

28
00:01:28,715 --> 00:01:31,825
Now, since 1 out of every 10,000 patients is sick,

29
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:34,305
then from this group of 1 million patients,

30
00:01:34,305 --> 00:01:40,330
100 will be sick and the remaining 999,900 will be healthy.

31
00:01:40,329 --> 00:01:43,250
Now let's remember that for every 100 patients,

32
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:47,230
99 get correctly diagnosed and one gets incorrectly diagnosed,

33
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:50,950
this happens both for sick and for healthy patients.

34
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:55,525
So, let's see how many of these patients will get diagnosed positively or negatively.

35
00:01:55,525 --> 00:01:58,120
Out of the 100 sick ones,

36
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,520
99 will be correctly diagnosed as

37
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:05,034
positive and one will be incorrectly diagnosed as negative.

38
00:02:05,034 --> 00:02:06,769
Now, out of the healthy ones,

39
00:02:06,769 --> 00:02:12,789
1 percent or 9,999 will be incorrectly diagnosed as positive and

40
00:02:12,789 --> 00:02:20,155
the remaining 99 percent or 989,901 will be correctly diagnosed as negative.

41
00:02:20,155 --> 00:02:22,360
Now let's really examine these four groups.

42
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,175
The first group is the sick people who we will send for more test or treatment.

43
00:02:27,175 --> 00:02:31,615
The second is the unlucky sick people that will be sent home with no treatment.

44
00:02:31,615 --> 00:02:36,790
The third is a slightly confused healthy people who will be sent for more tests.

45
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:39,389
And the fourth group or the majority is

46
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:42,754
the people who are healthy and were correctly diagnosed healthy and sent home.

47
00:02:42,754 --> 00:02:44,439
But now, here's the thing,

48
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:46,164
we know we tested positively,

49
00:02:46,164 --> 00:02:48,784
so we must be among one of these two groups,

50
00:02:48,784 --> 00:02:54,699
the sick people who tested positively or the healthy people who tested positively.

51
00:02:54,699 --> 00:02:56,199
One group is much larger,

52
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:58,750
it has 9,999 people,

53
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,379
whereas the other one has only 99 people.

54
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:07,359
The probability that we're in this group is much larger than that we're in this group.

55
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,640
As a matter of fact, the probability that we are in the small group is

56
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:17,834
99 divided by the sum, 99 plus 9,999,

57
00:03:17,835 --> 00:03:22,625
which is, you guessed it, 0.0098,

58
00:03:22,625 --> 00:03:24,955
which is smaller than 1 percent,

59
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:30,925
this is the probability of being sick if you are diagnosed as positive.

60
00:03:30,925 --> 00:03:34,320
But why is the group of healthy people who tested positively so

61
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,745
much larger than the group of sick people who tested positively?

62
00:03:37,745 --> 00:03:39,060
The reason is because,

63
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:42,030
even though the test only fails 1 percent of the time,

64
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:43,740
that 1 percent is much,

65
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:48,825
much larger than the one out of 10,000 rate of sickness among the population.

66
00:03:48,824 --> 00:03:53,294
In other words, in a group of 10,000 healthy people,

67
00:03:53,294 --> 00:03:57,219
1 percent or a 100 of them will get misdiagnosed as sick.

68
00:03:57,219 --> 00:03:58,594
On the other hand,

69
00:03:58,594 --> 00:04:00,634
in a group of 10,000 people,

70
00:04:00,634 --> 00:04:02,599
around one will be sick,

71
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:04,150
this is much less.

72
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,555
So if you know you've tested positively,

73
00:04:06,555 --> 00:04:12,425
you are still more likely to be among the 100 errors than among the ones sick.

74
00:04:12,425 --> 00:04:13,910
And how much more likely?

75
00:04:13,909 --> 00:04:16,920
Around 100 times, and that's why our probability of being

76
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:20,730
sick while being diagnosed positively is around 1 percent.

77
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:23,280
This phenomenon is called the False Positive,

78
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:25,079
and it has been a nightmare for the medical world,

79
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:26,930
the legal world and many others.

80
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:29,084
Search False Positives on Google,

81
00:04:29,084 --> 00:04:34,229
and you'll see many cases in which people have been misdiagnosed, misjudged etc.

82
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:36,330
So always be aware of false positives,

83
00:04:36,329 --> 00:04:38,129
they are very sneaky.
