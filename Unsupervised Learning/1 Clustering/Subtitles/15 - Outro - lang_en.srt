Nice job with this lesson.

2
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:05,910
You now know a lot more about how k-means works,

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:09,370
but k-means isn't the only way we can cluster data.

4
00:00:09,369 --> 00:00:10,734
In the next lesson,

5
00:00:10,734 --> 00:00:15,599
Jay will show you some additional methods you might use to cluster your data.
