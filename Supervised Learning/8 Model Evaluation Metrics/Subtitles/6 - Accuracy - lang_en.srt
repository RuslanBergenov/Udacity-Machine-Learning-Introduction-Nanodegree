1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,270
Now, we'll study one of the ways to measure how good a model is,

2
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,695
called that the accuracy.

3
00:00:04,695 --> 00:00:06,820
The accuracy is the answer to the question,

4
00:00:06,820 --> 00:00:10,335
"Out of all the patients, how many did we classify correctly?"

5
00:00:10,335 --> 00:00:13,500
The answer is, the ratio between the number of

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,350
correctly classified points and the number of total points.

7
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:21,570
In this example, we can see that we have correctly classified 9,000 patients,

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,350
which is a sum of 1,000 healthy and 8,000 sequence.

9
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:31,040
So, the accuracy is this number divided by the total number of patients, which is 10,000.

10
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:33,585
This gives us an accuracy of 90%.

11
00:00:33,585 --> 00:00:38,780
Accuracy can easily be calculated as you can learn by using the accuracy score function.

12
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:42,795
Now, let's see how much is the accuracy of the spam detector model?

13
00:00:42,795 --> 00:00:44,100
This is the answer to the question,

14
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,165
"Out of all the emails, how many did we classify correctly?"

15
00:00:47,165 --> 00:00:51,789
Since we have correctly classified 800 out of the 1,000 emails,

16
00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:54,770
then the answer is 80%.

17
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:56,660
Now, let's test your knowledge.

18
00:00:56,660 --> 00:00:59,230
In this model, what is the accuracy?

19
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:00,846
Please write the numbers of percentage.

20
00:01:00,846 --> 00:01:02,930
So, a number between 0 and 100.

21
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:05,320
This number can have decimals.
