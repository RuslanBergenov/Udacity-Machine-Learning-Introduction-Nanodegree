1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,000
Regardless of which type of networking
event you attend, the number one thing

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,870
that will help you navigate all of
them is having a great elevator pitch.

3
00:00:07,870 --> 00:00:10,530
Elevator pitches were originally
known as sales pitches and

4
00:00:10,529 --> 00:00:12,250
lived solely in the business world.

5
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:16,079
However, they soon became popular across
all industries because it was a way for

6
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:19,449
people to quickly communicate
the purpose and value of something.

7
00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:22,669
Having a elevator pitch is invaluable
in your career development.

8
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:25,690
These short sentences will find their
way in your LinkedIn summaries,

9
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,580
in talking to a recruiter,
in small talk with friends, or

10
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:30,369
in requesting a promotion.

11
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:34,410
Elevator pitches also help outside of
networking, such as in a job interview,

12
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:37,149
when the employer asks you why you're
applying or what you're interested in.

13
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,330
I have to admit that I did not like my
first experience with elevator pitches.

14
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:45,259
I was at a professional development
event and was put in with a group

15
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:49,929
of strangers, and we all had to respond
to the prompt, tell me about yourself.

16
00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:50,899
I was first.

17
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:51,979
I rambled.

18
00:00:51,979 --> 00:00:55,464
I've locked a lot of that
experience from my memory, but

19
00:00:55,465 --> 00:00:58,378
I'm sure I sounded like this,
hi, I'm Trinh.

20
00:00:58,378 --> 00:01:03,230
I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area,
and I go to school.

21
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:07,989
And I'm interested in education,
but I've never worked in education.

22
00:01:07,989 --> 00:01:12,030
And yeah, that's why I'm here today,
to help me make that transition.

23
00:01:13,989 --> 00:01:15,569
I was really embarrassed.

24
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:17,397
Especially when everyone
else gave their answers and

25
00:01:17,397 --> 00:01:19,629
it sounded like they had
their life together.

26
00:01:19,629 --> 00:01:23,049
But it was also a great learning
experience because after hearing myself,

27
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:25,739
I kept thinking, why do I need
to tell people where I grew up?

28
00:01:25,739 --> 00:01:28,359
Is that really important for my career?

29
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:30,909
Why did they need to know that
I was transitioning careers or

30
00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:32,670
that I was new to this industry?

31
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:35,810
I was at the event, doesn't that
mean I was already interested?

32
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:39,800
This experience taught me that if
I wanted to sound confident and

33
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:44,009
communicate well, I needed a concise
elevator pitch that showed what I wanted

34
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,480
and why I wanted it.

35
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:47,340
My elevator pitch now is,

36
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:50,710
I'm a project manager passionate
about personalized education.

37
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:52,959
After working in non-profits and
public policy,

38
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:56,399
I believe lifelong learning is
the solution to many societal issues.

39
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,850
I'm excited to apply my teaching and
management skills at Udacity.

40
00:01:59,849 --> 00:02:03,009
So, let's dive in to how to develop an
elevator pitch with personal branding in

41
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:03,280
mind.
