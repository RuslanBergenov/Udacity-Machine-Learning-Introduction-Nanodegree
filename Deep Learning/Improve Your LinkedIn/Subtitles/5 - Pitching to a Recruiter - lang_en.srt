00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:01,399
Hi, I'm Chris.

2
00:00:01,399 --> 00:00:01,989
>> Hi, I'm Trinh.

3
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:02,549
Nice to meet you.

4
00:00:02,549 --> 00:00:03,309
>> Nice to meet you too.

5
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:04,560
Are you a software engineer?

6
00:00:04,559 --> 00:00:07,330
>> No, actually,
I'm a technical recruiter at Udacity.

7
00:00:07,331 --> 00:00:09,400
>> Cool, I actually really like Udacity.

8
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,719
I'm taking a number of
Udacity's online courses.

9
00:00:11,718 --> 00:00:13,788
You guys have really helped
me learn at my own pace.

10
00:00:13,788 --> 00:00:17,850
And I love that I have
a flexible learning time.

11
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,060
>> That's really awesome to hear.

12
00:00:19,059 --> 00:00:20,657
Which projects have you been working on?

13
00:00:20,658 --> 00:00:23,211
>> So I actually recently
was building an application.

14
00:00:23,211 --> 00:00:26,570
That let's teachers share
student responses anonymously.

15
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,272
And it's been going really well.

16
00:00:28,272 --> 00:00:31,155
I'm trying to actually
add in graphic UL.

17
00:00:31,155 --> 00:00:33,054
Which is a fairly recent technology.

18
00:00:33,054 --> 00:00:35,435
So that way I can query
the data a little bit easier.

19
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:38,394
>> It's actually pretty funny that you
mentioned working on an app like that.

20
00:00:38,393 --> 00:00:41,750
Because Udacity is looking into
developing something similar.

21
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:42,500
>> Very cool!

22
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,366
Could I get your card?

23
00:00:43,366 --> 00:00:44,201
>> Yeah, of course.

24
00:00:44,201 --> 00:00:45,407
I'd really love to hear from you.

25
00:00:45,406 --> 00:00:47,292
So send me an email after this mixer.

26
00:00:47,292 --> 00:00:49,329
>> Great, thanks so
much, nice to meet you.

27
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:49,920
>> Nice to meet you, too.
