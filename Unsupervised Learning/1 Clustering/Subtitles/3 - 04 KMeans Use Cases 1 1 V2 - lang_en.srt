00:00:04,519 --> 00:00:08,369
One of the most popular clustering algorithms in

2
00:00:08,369 --> 00:00:11,719
all of machine learning is known as the K-means algorithm.

3
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,730
This algorithm is used to cluster books,

4
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:20,539
and articles that are similar which has helped to identify otherwise anonymous authors.

5
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:24,434
It's also used to cluster similar movies and music

6
00:00:24,434 --> 00:00:28,899
for the purpose of recommending new items on Netflix or Spotify.

7
00:00:28,899 --> 00:00:32,210
Another very common use case of K-means is to

8
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:35,535
cluster the behaviors of customers to better understand,

9
00:00:35,534 --> 00:00:37,489
similar groups of purchasers,

10
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:40,130
and identify the best approach for recommending

11
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:43,130
new items based on their purchasing habits.

12
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:45,980
Using K-means to group similar customers,

13
00:00:45,979 --> 00:00:48,839
is done by advertising platforms from Google,

14
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,930
to Facebook, to Amazon.

15
00:00:50,929 --> 00:00:55,369
Maybe someday, it will even be a part of the education space where we're

16
00:00:55,369 --> 00:01:00,039
develop learning strategies based on clustering different types of learners.

17
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:06,560
With that, let's take a closer look at how K-means works and put it to use on a data set.
