1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,294
Now, in order to combine models,

2
00:00:02,294 --> 00:00:05,344
we'll actually weight them by how well they're doing.

3
00:00:05,344 --> 00:00:09,509
In this way, if one of our friends just answers the questions better,

4
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,369
we'll believe that friend more.

5
00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:13,695
So let's turn to a hypothetical question.

6
00:00:13,695 --> 00:00:15,005
We have three friends.

7
00:00:15,005 --> 00:00:17,125
One always tells the truth,

8
00:00:17,125 --> 00:00:21,195
the other one tells the truth half of the time and lies half of the time,

9
00:00:21,195 --> 00:00:22,684
and we don't know which half,

10
00:00:22,684 --> 00:00:24,974
and the third one always lies.

11
00:00:24,975 --> 00:00:29,785
The question is, which one of these three is the one that we should ignore the most?

12
00:00:29,785 --> 00:00:32,039
Equivalently, here we have three models.

13
00:00:32,039 --> 00:00:34,140
The first one is always correct,

14
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,649
the second one is correct half of the time,

15
00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:39,354
and the third one is wrong every single time.

16
00:00:39,354 --> 00:00:42,189
Which of these models is worse for us?

17
00:00:42,189 --> 00:00:44,129
