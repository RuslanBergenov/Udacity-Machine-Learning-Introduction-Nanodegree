1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,690
So to summarize, this is how I see machine learning.

2
00:00:02,690 --> 00:00:05,810
We have a problem to solve which is represented by this broken car over

3
00:00:05,809 --> 00:00:10,695
here and we have some tools to fix it which are the algorithms of machine learning.

4
00:00:10,695 --> 00:00:13,140
Finally, you have some measurement tools,

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,160
which we then use to measure each tool's performance.

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,210
Then you pick the best tool to fix your car.

7
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:21,269
To be more specific in machine learning you have

8
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:24,204
a problem which is some data you need to classify.

9
00:00:24,204 --> 00:00:27,079
You also have a bunch of algorithms things like neural networks,

10
00:00:27,079 --> 00:00:30,820
logistic regression, polynomial regression as VMs, decision trees,

11
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,844
random forests et cetera and we have a bunch of metrics,

12
00:00:33,844 --> 00:00:35,765
things like model complexity graphs,

13
00:00:35,765 --> 00:00:38,954
accuracy precision, recall, F1 score,

14
00:00:38,954 --> 00:00:40,759
learning curves et cetera.

15
00:00:40,759 --> 00:00:44,649
What you do, is you use these ones to test your models,

16
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:49,519
see how they're doing, pick the best one and that's what you use to model your data.

17
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,405
Then when you have a new point,

18
00:00:51,405 --> 00:00:54,465
you can predict it's label based on that model.

19
00:00:54,465 --> 00:00:56,450
That's it. That's how you test,

20
00:00:56,450 --> 00:00:58,540
evaluate and validate models.
