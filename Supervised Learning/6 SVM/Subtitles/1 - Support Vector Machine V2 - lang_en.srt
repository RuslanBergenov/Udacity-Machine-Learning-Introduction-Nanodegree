Hello again and welcome to the support vector machine section.

2
00:00:03,476 --> 00:00:06,000
Support vector machines are a very powerful algorithm

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,030
for classification that not only aims to classify the data,

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:12,315
but it also aims to find the best possible boundary, namely,

5
00:00:12,315 --> 00:00:16,200
the one that maintains the largest distance from the points. Let's see how it works.
