00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:10,119
This lesson provided some more context as to the current state of machine learning,

2
00:00:10,119 --> 00:00:14,619
and how it's evolved from the fields of statistics, and computer science.

3
00:00:14,619 --> 00:00:18,804
You got to look at three branches of machine learning: supervised learning,

4
00:00:18,804 --> 00:00:21,964
unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

5
00:00:21,964 --> 00:00:24,120
We also discussed at a high level

6
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,245
scikit-learn as a library in Python for machine learning,

7
00:00:27,245 --> 00:00:31,385
and deep learning, as a popular technique currently leading the way.

8
00:00:31,385 --> 00:00:35,039
You will get more experience with both of these in the material ahead.

9
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:39,189
Finally, we looked at the ethical challenges ahead of us in the field.

10
00:00:39,189 --> 00:00:41,390
Now that you have an overview of the field,

11
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:43,465
it's time to dive more into the details.

12
00:00:43,465 --> 00:00:45,740
First, Release will be showing you how

13
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:50,870
the most popular supervised learning techniques work. Let's get started.
