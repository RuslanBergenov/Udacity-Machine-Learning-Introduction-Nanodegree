1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,589
Bayes Theorem can get a little more complex.

2
00:00:02,589 --> 00:00:04,839
Let's take a look at a small example and what we'll

3
00:00:04,839 --> 00:00:07,810
do here is we'll mess a bit with the prior probability.

4
00:00:07,809 --> 00:00:10,759
So again, we have Alex and Brenda in the office,

5
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:14,849
and we saw someone pass by quickly and we don't know who the person is.

6
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:17,570
So let's say we look more carefully at their schedules and we

7
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:21,195
realized that Alex actually works from the office most of the time.

8
00:00:21,195 --> 00:00:23,704
He comes by three days a week.

9
00:00:23,704 --> 00:00:26,119
And Brenda travels a lot for work, so,

10
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,630
she actually comes to the office only one day a week.

11
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:32,314
So initially, without knowing anything about the red sweater,

12
00:00:32,314 --> 00:00:37,609
all we know is that it's three times more likely to see Alex than to see Brenda.

13
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:45,394
Therefore our prior probabilities are 0.75 for Alex and 0.25 for Brenda.

14
00:00:45,395 --> 00:00:48,840
And let's say that we have this happening throughout all the weeks,

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:53,680
but now we use our extra knowledge which is that the person we saw had a red sweater.

16
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:55,655
The rule is still as before,

17
00:00:55,655 --> 00:01:01,329
as Alex wears red twice a week and Brenda wears red three times a week.

18
00:01:01,329 --> 00:01:06,739
So, naively we would think that the real probabilities are not exactly

19
00:01:06,739 --> 00:01:12,009
0.75 or 0.25 because Brenda wears a red sweater more than Alex,

20
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:14,395
so they should be a little closer to each other.

21
00:01:14,394 --> 00:01:17,924
Let's calculate them. So, we'll do the following,

22
00:01:17,924 --> 00:01:21,105
let's think of the columns as weeks instead.

23
00:01:21,105 --> 00:01:24,350
So, now for each five-day work week,

24
00:01:24,349 --> 00:01:27,959
Alex wears red twice and Brenda three times.

25
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:30,489
So, we colored the days they wore red.

26
00:01:30,489 --> 00:01:33,199
Now, since we know the person wore red,

27
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,375
we forget about the times that they didn't.

28
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:38,489
So we have nine times someone wore red.

29
00:01:38,489 --> 00:01:41,939
Six of them are Alex and three of them are Brenda.

30
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:46,504
Therefore, among nine times we saw someone wearing red,

31
00:01:46,504 --> 00:01:50,569
two-thirds of the times it with Alex and one third of the time it was Brenda.

32
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:55,199
Thus, our posterior probabilities are two-thirds

33
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,225
or 0.67 for Alex and one third or 0.33 for Brenda.

34
00:02:01,224 --> 00:02:03,194
So it looks like we did a little bit of magic.

35
00:02:03,194 --> 00:02:05,454
Let's do this again in a more mathematical way.

36
00:02:05,454 --> 00:02:10,079
We saw a person and initially all we know is that it's Alex with

37
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,390
a 75% probability and Brenda with

38
00:02:13,389 --> 00:02:15,699
a 25% probability since

39
00:02:15,699 --> 00:02:19,185
Alex comes to the office three times a week and Brenda once a week.

40
00:02:19,185 --> 00:02:23,439
But now new information comes to light which is that the person is wearing

41
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:29,229
a red sweater and the data says that Alex wears red two times a week.

42
00:02:29,229 --> 00:02:31,069
So now we look at Alex.

43
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:33,689
What is the probability that he's wearing red?

44
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:36,729
Since a work week has five days and the probability of him

45
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:40,974
wearing red is two-fifths or 0.4.

46
00:02:40,974 --> 00:02:45,780
And the probability of him not wearing red is the complement, so 0.6.

47
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,590
Same thing with Brenda, since she wears red three three a week,

48
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,629
then the probability of her wearing red today is

49
00:02:52,629 --> 00:02:58,215
0.6 and the probability of her not wearing red is 0.4.

50
00:02:58,215 --> 00:03:00,729
Now, by the formula of conditional probability,

51
00:03:00,729 --> 00:03:02,679
the probability that these two will happen is

52
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:06,085
the product of the two probabilities P of Alex,

53
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:08,034
times P of red given Alex.

54
00:03:08,034 --> 00:03:11,819
Therefore, the probability of the person we saw is Alex and that they're

55
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:16,814
wearing red is precisely 0.75 times 0.4.

56
00:03:16,814 --> 00:03:19,465
We multiply them and put the result here.

57
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:22,050
We calculate the other probabilities in the same way,

58
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:24,700
that probability of the person we saw is Alex and that he's not

59
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:28,219
wearing red is 0.75 times 0.6.

60
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:31,539
The probability of the person we saw is Brenda and that she's wearing red,

61
00:03:31,539 --> 00:03:33,539
is again the product of these probabilities,

62
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:35,799
which is 0.25 times 0.6.

63
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:38,700
And finally, the probability of the person we saw is Brenda and

64
00:03:38,699 --> 00:03:42,159
she's not wearing red is 0.25 times 0.4.

65
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,310
And now here's where the Bayesian magic happens, are you ready?

66
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,504
We have four possible scenarios

67
00:03:47,504 --> 00:03:50,125
and you can check that these four probabilities add to one.

68
00:03:50,125 --> 00:03:52,055
But we know one thing,

69
00:03:52,055 --> 00:03:54,990
that the person we saw was wearing red.

70
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:57,844
Therefore, out of these four scenarios,

71
00:03:57,844 --> 00:03:59,539
only two are plausible,

72
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:02,364
the two when the person is wearing red.

73
00:04:02,365 --> 00:04:04,409
So, we forget about the other two.

74
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:08,495
Now, since our new universe consists of only these two scenarios,

75
00:04:08,495 --> 00:04:10,865
then the probability should be higher,

76
00:04:10,865 --> 00:04:15,155
but their ratio should still be the same with respect to each other.

77
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:19,365
This means, we need to normalize them or equivalently,

78
00:04:19,365 --> 00:04:22,615
divide them by something so that they now add to one.

79
00:04:22,615 --> 00:04:24,300
The thing we should divide them by,

80
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,790
is the sum of the two.

81
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:31,085
So, our new probability of the person being Alex is the top one, namely,

82
00:04:31,084 --> 00:04:35,544
0.75 times 0.4 divided by the sum of the two,

83
00:04:35,545 --> 00:04:38,025
namely, 0.75 times four,

84
00:04:38,024 --> 00:04:40,839
plus 0.25 zero times 0.6.

85
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:45,169
This is precisely two-thirds or 0.67,

86
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:49,145
and now we can see that the complement is the probability that the person is Brenda,

87
00:04:49,144 --> 00:04:52,379
which is one third or 0.33.

88
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:55,629
If we take Brenda's probability and divide it by the sum of

89
00:04:55,629 --> 00:05:00,154
both probabilities we can see that we get one third as desired.

90
00:05:00,154 --> 00:05:04,399
And that's it, that is Bayes Theorem at its full potential.
