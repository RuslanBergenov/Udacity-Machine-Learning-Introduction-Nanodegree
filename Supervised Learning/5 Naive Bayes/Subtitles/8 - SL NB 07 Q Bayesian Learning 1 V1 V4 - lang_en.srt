1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,514
Now the question is, how do we use this wonderful Bayes theorem to do machine learning.

2
00:00:04,514 --> 00:00:06,644
And the answer is repeatedly.

3
00:00:06,644 --> 00:00:08,669
Let's look at this example,

4
00:00:08,669 --> 00:00:11,009
a spam email classifier.

5
00:00:11,009 --> 00:00:14,189
So let's say, we have some data in the form of a bunch of emails.

6
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:17,894
Some of them are spam and some of them are not spam, which we call ham.

7
00:00:17,894 --> 00:00:20,820
Spam are, "Win money now!" "Make cash easy!"

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:22,320
et cetera. And the ham are,

9
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:23,925
"How are you?" "There you are!"

10
00:00:23,925 --> 00:00:27,030
et cetera. And now, what we'll do is,

11
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,429
a new email comes in say,

12
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:33,090
"easy money" and we want to check if it's spam or ham.

13
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,830
So, we take it word by word.

14
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:39,179
Of course, we can be more effective if we took into account the order of the words,

15
00:00:39,179 --> 00:00:41,085
but for this classifier, we won't.

16
00:00:41,085 --> 00:00:43,380
It's surprising how good it can be even if it

17
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,915
doesn't take into account the order of the words.

18
00:00:45,914 --> 00:00:48,314
So let's study the first word say, "easy."

19
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:50,820
We can see that the word "easy" appears once among

20
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,140
the three spam emails and once among the five ham emails.

21
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,899
And the word "money" appears twice among

22
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,229
the three spam emails and once among the five ham emails.

23
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:05,280
So, let's start with calculating some preliminary probabilities as an exercise.

24
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,049
Given the data we have,

25
00:01:07,049 --> 00:01:09,509
what is the probability of an email containing the word

26
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:13,530
"easy" given that it is spam? Here are some options.

27
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,230
And let's also calculate it for the other word.

28
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:19,640
Again given our data, what's the probability of an email being

29
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,890
spam given that it contains the word "money"?

30
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:24,920
Here are the options.

31
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,400
Enter your answer below.
