1
00:00:04,730 --> 00:00:10,380
Machine learning has three main categories: supervised,

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,825
unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.

3
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:15,654
In supervised machine learning,

4
00:00:15,654 --> 00:00:18,320
our algorithms learn from labeled data.

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,530
After studying the labeled data,

6
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:24,630
these techniques are able to determine which label should be given to

7
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:27,359
new data based on observing patterns and

8
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,089
associating those patterns to new unlabeled data.

9
00:00:31,089 --> 00:00:37,880
Supervised learning can be divided into two categories: classification and regression.

10
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,295
Classification models predict a category that an item belongs to.

11
00:00:42,295 --> 00:00:45,380
Many people believed that these models are used for

12
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,230
events with only two possible outcomes,

13
00:00:48,229 --> 00:00:50,750
like whether an email is spam or not,

14
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:55,564
but most can actually be extended to predict any number of categories.

15
00:00:55,564 --> 00:00:59,269
For example, there are classification techniques that allow us

16
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:03,285
to predict which of many breeds a dog belongs to.

17
00:01:03,284 --> 00:01:06,614
Alternatively, regression models predict

18
00:01:06,614 --> 00:01:10,459
a numeric value like home price or an individual's height.

19
00:01:10,459 --> 00:01:12,890
You will learn about these techniques

20
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:16,459
in the supervised machine learning part of this program.
