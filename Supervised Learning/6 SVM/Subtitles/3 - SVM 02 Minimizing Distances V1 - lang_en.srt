1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,620
So, if you said the line on the left, you are correct.

2
00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:03,690
Because as you can see,

3
00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,429
the yellow line is pretty well-spaced

4
00:00:05,429 --> 00:00:07,469
between the blue points and the red points, whereas,

5
00:00:07,469 --> 00:00:08,789
the green line is not,

6
00:00:08,789 --> 00:00:12,309
because it's a little too close to some of the points on both sides.

7
00:00:12,310 --> 00:00:14,370
And how can we see this? Well, we look at

8
00:00:14,369 --> 00:00:16,500
all the distances between the closest point to one

9
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,059
of the lines and compare them to

10
00:00:18,059 --> 00:00:20,939
the distances between the closest points to the other line.

11
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:23,429
So, the closest point to the yellow line is this one and

12
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:26,039
the closest point to the green line is this one over here.

13
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:29,804
And then, we check, which one of these closest points is actually farther from the line?

14
00:00:29,804 --> 00:00:32,399
So, we compare these two distances and we see

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,475
that the one on the left is bigger, so that line wins.

16
00:00:35,475 --> 00:00:37,995
In a nutshell, this is how an SVM works.

17
00:00:37,994 --> 00:00:41,390
But throughout this lesson, I'll be showing you this algorithm in more detail.
