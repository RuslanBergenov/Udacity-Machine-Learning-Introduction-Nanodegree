00:00:00,270 --> 00:00:01,670
Hi, we're back.

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:06,840
So I've been wondering, how you know
if somebody is a good collaborator,

3
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:09,940
right, because these candidates
when they get their job,

4
00:00:09,940 --> 00:00:14,510
they have to work with other
people on shared code basis.

5
00:00:14,510 --> 00:00:18,327
So how do you know from a GitHub profile
if somebody is going to be a good

6
00:00:18,327 --> 00:00:19,292
collaborator?

7
00:00:19,292 --> 00:00:22,838
>> So one thing I do to screen people
for how they'll work well in a team or

8
00:00:22,838 --> 00:00:26,384
how well they work on our team,
is to sort of branch out from the GitHub

9
00:00:26,384 --> 00:00:30,545
profile and maybe start with the issues
on the repo that they've participated in

10
00:00:30,545 --> 00:00:33,359
and see how they've participated
in those threads and

11
00:00:33,359 --> 00:00:37,274
if they've commented in on poll requests
and whatnot and just get a sense for

12
00:00:37,274 --> 00:00:40,021
how they interact with other
engineers in the repo.

13
00:00:40,021 --> 00:00:44,798
Particularly one thing that I think is
really interesting is, whether they're

14
00:00:44,798 --> 00:00:49,295
patient with the kind of people who may
be newer to the community and then from

15
00:00:49,295 --> 00:00:53,931
there, let say you branch out and maybe
find if there's an Internet Relay Chat

16
00:00:53,931 --> 00:00:58,076
channel that they may have been related
to a repo and look at the logs and

17
00:00:58,076 --> 00:01:02,361
just see, are they're helpful,
are they kind, or are they patient and

18
00:01:02,361 --> 00:01:06,928
it's such an important signal because at
the end of the day, you really want to

19
00:01:06,928 --> 00:01:11,330
hire people that are going to work
well and be a good fit for your team.

20
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,973
So yeah, I spend a lot of time doing
that, just kind of digging in and

21
00:01:13,973 --> 00:01:16,840
seeing how they interact with
other engineers publicly.

22
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,680
>> Yeah.

23
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,781
So when you're talking about interacting
with other engineers publicly,

24
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:24,095
you mean on open source projects, right.

25
00:01:24,095 --> 00:01:28,533
I know personally, it's very daunting to
start working on this big library and

26
00:01:28,533 --> 00:01:32,100
all these other really
intelligent people working on.

27
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,960
So how would you start, or what's your
advice for a beginner, a new programmer,

28
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,776
to actually start contributing
to these open source projects?

29
00:01:40,776 --> 00:01:42,740
>> It's a great point, Matt.

30
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:47,700
It's really daunting even for me,
and I know one thing that I do and

31
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,040
that I recommend people do to
just sort of break the ice with

32
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,937
a new project is like find some
documentation, even the ReadMe.

33
00:01:56,937 --> 00:02:00,690
One thing I love to do is actually go
through the ReadMe, clone the project,

34
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:04,560
try to build it, try to get it running,
following the steps in the ReadMe, and

35
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,904
then like try to clarify it based on
the sort of problems that I have,

36
00:02:07,904 --> 00:02:10,190
maybe it just needs to
be updated a little bit,

37
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,950
submit a poll request with
a few changes to the ReadMe.

38
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:14,255
Those almost always get accepted.

39
00:02:14,255 --> 00:02:16,500
[LAUGH] And
it's just a great way to break the ice.

40
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,750
I mean, you're going to move
on to actually fixing bugs and

41
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,280
then maybe actually contributing
features, but just to sort of get into

42
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,280
that community and get over that
initial hump of feeling intimidated and

43
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:26,780
there's just so much code and
not knowing where to start,

44
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,670
I find contributing some documentation
is a great way to start.

45
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:30,170
>> Cool.
