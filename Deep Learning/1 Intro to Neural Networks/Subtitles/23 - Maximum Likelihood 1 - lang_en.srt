1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,859
So we're still in our quest for an algorithm that will help

2
00:00:02,859 --> 00:00:05,525
us pick the best model that separates our data.

3
00:00:05,525 --> 00:00:09,984
Well, since we're dealing with probabilities then let's use them in our favor.

4
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:12,894
Let's say I'm a student and I have two models.

5
00:00:12,894 --> 00:00:16,300
One that tells me that my probability of getting accepted is

6
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:20,859
80% and one that tells me the probability is 55%.

7
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:22,855
Which model looks more accurate?

8
00:00:22,855 --> 00:00:24,879
Well, if I got accepted then I'd say

9
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:28,210
the better model is probably the one that says 80%.

10
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:29,679
What if I didn't get accepted?

11
00:00:29,678 --> 00:00:33,983
Then the more accurate model is more likely the one that says 55 percent.

12
00:00:33,984 --> 00:00:37,469
But I'm just one person. What if it was me and a friend?

13
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:40,789
Well, the best model would more likely be the one that

14
00:00:40,789 --> 00:00:44,506
gives the higher probabilities to the events that happened to us,

15
00:00:44,506 --> 00:00:47,085
whether it's acceptance or rejection.

16
00:00:47,085 --> 00:00:49,149
This sounds pretty intuitive.

17
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:52,310
The method is called maximum likelihood.

18
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:58,353
What we do is we pick the model that gives the existing labels the highest probability.

19
00:00:58,353 --> 00:01:00,259
Thus, by maximizing the probability,

20
00:01:00,259 --> 00:01:02,000
we can pick the best possible model.
