1
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:04,000
Okay, so before we continue with other
algorithms, let's do a little aside.

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:07,810
Let's say we found ourselves
on top of a mountain.

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:09,900
Mount Errorest.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:10,910
And our goal is to get to
the bottom of the mountain.

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:13,920
So what strategy can we use?

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,240
Well, we can do it step by step.

7
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:19,290
We look around us in all the possible
directions we can go and

8
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,980
find out which direction will
get us to descend the most.

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,800
In this case,
it's this direction over here.

10
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,819
So we take one step in that direction.

11
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,169
And then we restart the process.

12
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,950
We look around us, and see in which
directions we descend the most.

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,430
And take a step in that direction.

14
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,739
And we continue this process
until we descend the mountain.

15
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:45,750
This algorithm is called
gradient descent, and

16
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,490
we'll be using it extensively
in machine learning.

17
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:52,349
You can think of the mountain as
a problem you want to solve, and

18
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:54,180
the bottom of the mountain
as the solution.

19
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,940
And our process to solve
the problem is to take

20
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:01,500
tiny steps in the correct direction
that will get us to the solution.
