1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,399
Now we'll learn another technique to evaluate

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,400
a model called the receiver operator characteristic curve,

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:07,305
or ROC curve for short.

4
00:00:07,304 --> 00:00:11,460
It works as follows; consider this data which is now one dimensional,

5
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:16,515
so all the red and blue points lie in one line and we want to find the correct split.

6
00:00:16,515 --> 00:00:21,405
So, we can have a split around here or maybe here or here,

7
00:00:21,405 --> 00:00:22,769
all of them are good splits.

8
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:24,809
So, we'll call this a good split.

9
00:00:24,809 --> 00:00:27,059
Now we can look at this data,

10
00:00:27,059 --> 00:00:30,214
which as you can see is perfectly separable over here.

11
00:00:30,214 --> 00:00:32,475
So we'll call that a perfect split.

12
00:00:32,475 --> 00:00:34,780
Finally, we have this data over here which is pretty much

13
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:37,340
random and there's not much to split here.

14
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:39,310
It seemed that anywhere we put the boundary,

15
00:00:39,310 --> 00:00:40,539
we'll have about half blue,

16
00:00:40,539 --> 00:00:42,310
half red points on each side.

17
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,280
So we'll call that a bad split or a random split.

18
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,469
Now what we want is to come up with a metric or

19
00:00:47,469 --> 00:00:50,019
some number that is high for the perfect split,

20
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,610
medium for the good split,

21
00:00:51,609 --> 00:00:53,225
and low for the random split.

22
00:00:53,225 --> 00:00:56,820
In fact, something that gives the perfect split a score of 1.0,

23
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:59,024
the good split something around 0.8,

24
00:00:59,024 --> 00:01:02,030
and the random split something around 0.5.

25
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,689
That's where the ROC curve will help us.

26
00:01:04,689 --> 00:01:06,489
So let's see how to construct these numbers.

27
00:01:06,489 --> 00:01:09,719
Let's take our good data and let's cut it over here.

28
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:12,084
Now, we'll calculate two ratios.

29
00:01:12,084 --> 00:01:13,919
The first one is a true positive rate,

30
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,129
which means out of all the positively labeled points,

31
00:01:17,129 --> 00:01:19,664
how many did we classify correctly?

32
00:01:19,665 --> 00:01:22,470
That means the number of true positives divided

33
00:01:22,469 --> 00:01:25,515
by the total number of positively labeled points.

34
00:01:25,515 --> 00:01:27,480
So let's see how much this is.

35
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,480
There are seven positively labeled numbers

36
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,255
and six of them have been correctly labeled positive,

37
00:01:33,254 --> 00:01:39,179
so this ratio is six out of seven or 0.857.

38
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:41,780
Now let's look at the false positive rate,

39
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,730
which means out of all the negative points,

40
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:49,025
how many of them did the model incorrectly think they were positives?

41
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:53,054
So out of the seven negatively labeled points,

42
00:01:53,054 --> 00:01:55,725
the model thought two of them were positive.

43
00:01:55,724 --> 00:02:01,569
So the false positive rate is two out of seven or 0.286.

44
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,770
We'll just remember these two numbers.

45
00:02:04,769 --> 00:02:07,609
Now what we'll do is we'll move this boundary

46
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:10,879
around and calculate the same pair of numbers.

47
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:12,585
So let's split over here.

48
00:02:12,585 --> 00:02:15,175
What is the true positive rate over here?

49
00:02:15,175 --> 00:02:17,785
Well, the model thinks everything is positive.

50
00:02:17,784 --> 00:02:20,574
So in particular, all the positives are true positives.

51
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:25,254
So the true positive rate is 7 divided by 7, which is one.

52
00:02:25,254 --> 00:02:27,430
For the false positive rate, well,

53
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,599
since the model thinks everything is positive,

54
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:31,930
then all the negatives are false positive.

55
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:37,645
So the false positive rate is again 7 divided by 7, which is one.

56
00:02:37,645 --> 00:02:41,784
So again, we'll remember these two values, one and one.

57
00:02:41,784 --> 00:02:43,409
Now, let's go to the other extreme.

58
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:47,740
Let's put the bar over here and now let's see what is the true positive rate.

59
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:50,379
Well, the model thinks nothing is positive so in particular,

60
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:55,585
there are no true positives and the ratio is 0 divided by 7, which is zero.

61
00:02:55,585 --> 00:02:57,550
For the false positive rate, well, again,

62
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:59,675
the model thinks nothing is positive,

63
00:02:59,675 --> 00:03:03,594
so there are no false positives and the ratio is zero over seven,

64
00:03:03,594 --> 00:03:05,139
which again is zero.

65
00:03:05,139 --> 00:03:07,359
We'll remember these two numbers.

66
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,000
We can see that no matter how the data looks,

67
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,389
the two extremes will always be one,

68
00:03:13,389 --> 00:03:15,414
one and zero, zero.

69
00:03:15,414 --> 00:03:19,969
Now, we can do this for every possible split and record those numbers.

70
00:03:19,969 --> 00:03:22,469
So here we have a few of them that we've calculated.

71
00:03:22,469 --> 00:03:24,104
Now, the magic happens.

72
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:27,649
We just plot these numbers in the plane and we get a curve.

73
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:32,020
Now, we calculate the area under the curve and here we get around 0.8.

74
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,719
This is actually not accurate but it's around there.

75
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:37,439
You can calculate on your own and see how much you get.

76
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:39,909
So now, let's do the same thing for the perfect split.

77
00:03:39,909 --> 00:03:41,650
Here are all the ratios.

78
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,050
Notice that if the boundary is on the red side,

79
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,240
then the true positive ratio is one

80
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:49,060
since every positive number has been predicted positive.

81
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,219
Similarity, if the boundary is on the blue side,

82
00:03:51,219 --> 00:03:53,234
then every negative number has been predicted

83
00:03:53,235 --> 00:03:56,160
negative and so the false positive ratio is zero.

84
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,764
In particular, at the perfect split point,

85
00:03:58,764 --> 00:04:00,389
we have a zero, one.

86
00:04:00,389 --> 00:04:02,104
Thus, when we plot these numbers,

87
00:04:02,104 --> 00:04:05,869
the curve looks like a square and the square has area,

88
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:11,939
one, which means the area under the ROC curve for the perfect split is one.

89
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:14,259
Finally, we do this for the random split.

90
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:15,750
In here you can try it on your own,

91
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:20,100
but basically since every split leaves on each side around half blue, half red points,

92
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,689
then each pair of numbers will be close to each other,

93
00:04:22,689 --> 00:04:26,279
and the curve will be very close to being just a diagonal between zero,

94
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,824
zero and one, one.

95
00:04:27,824 --> 00:04:29,629
So if the model is random,

96
00:04:29,629 --> 00:04:33,389
then the area under the ROC curve is around 0.5.

97
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:36,209
So to summarize, we have three possible scenarios;

98
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,569
some random data which is hard to split,

99
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:42,290
some pretty good data which we can split well making some errors,

100
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:46,095
and some perfectly divided data which we can split with no errors.

101
00:04:46,095 --> 00:04:48,020
Each one is associated with a curve.

102
00:04:48,019 --> 00:04:52,474
The areas under the curve are close to 0.5 for the random model,

103
00:04:52,475 --> 00:04:55,055
somewhere close to one for the good model,

104
00:04:55,055 --> 00:04:58,730
so around 0.8, and one for the perfect model.

105
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:03,680
So in summary, the closer your area under the ROC curve is to one,

106
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,704
the better your model is.

107
00:05:05,704 --> 00:05:07,685
Now, here is a question,

108
00:05:07,685 --> 00:05:11,670
can the area under the curve be less than 0.5?

109
00:05:11,670 --> 00:05:15,390
In fact, yes. It can be all the way to zero.

110
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:18,504
How would a model look if the area under the curve is zero?

111
00:05:18,504 --> 00:05:20,394
Well, it will look more backwards.

112
00:05:20,394 --> 00:05:23,759
It'll have more blue points in the red area and the red points in the blue area,

113
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,930
so maybe flipping the data may help.
