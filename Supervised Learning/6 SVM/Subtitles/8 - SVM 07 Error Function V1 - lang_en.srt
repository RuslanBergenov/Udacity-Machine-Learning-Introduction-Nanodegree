1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,660
So, now that we've learned the classification error and the margin error,

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:05,540
all we have to do is put them together.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:08,070
So, our official SVM error is just

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:11,484
going to be the classification error plus the margin error.

5
00:00:11,484 --> 00:00:13,179
And how do we minimize this?

6
00:00:13,179 --> 00:00:17,000
We minimize it using gradient descent, just like before.
