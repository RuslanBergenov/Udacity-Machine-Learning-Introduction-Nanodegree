1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,234
Now, note that we can decide what radial basis functions to use.

2
00:00:03,234 --> 00:00:07,709
We can use some very wide ones or some very narrow ones. How do we decide?

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:09,960
Well, this is a hyper parameter that we tune

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:13,105
during training and it is called the gamma parameter.

5
00:00:13,105 --> 00:00:17,579
And in a nutshell, a large gamma will move us a narrow curve like the one on the left,

6
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:20,954
and a small gamma would give us a wide curve like this one in the right.

7
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:23,369
In higher dimensions, this is very similar.

8
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,670
A large gamma will give us some pointy mountains like the one on the left,

9
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:30,060
and a small one would give us mountains looking like the one in the right.

10
00:00:30,059 --> 00:00:33,134
And this choice of gamma actually matters a lot in the algorithm.

11
00:00:33,134 --> 00:00:36,265
Picture looking at your data from above or after the projection.

12
00:00:36,265 --> 00:00:38,039
If you used a bunch of skinny mountains,

13
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:40,049
then your boundary will look like the one on the left where

14
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:43,644
most points have their own little piece of boundary surrounding them.

15
00:00:43,645 --> 00:00:44,850
If you use wider mountains,

16
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:47,535
then you would end up with something like the boundary in the right.

17
00:00:47,534 --> 00:00:48,929
And as you can see from the picture,

18
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:51,119
large values of gamma tend to overfit,

19
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:53,399
and small ones tend to underfit.

20
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:54,644
And now, what is Gamma?

21
00:00:54,645 --> 00:00:58,185
Well, here's where we define with these radial basis functions are.

22
00:00:58,185 --> 00:01:01,200
We'll use the Gaussian or normal distribution for this.

23
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,920
The Gaussian is a very well-used function in statistics that has this formula,

24
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,079
y equals one over a square root of

25
00:01:07,079 --> 00:01:10,484
two pi times E to the power of negative x squared over two.

26
00:01:10,484 --> 00:01:15,025
In the general case, when you have a distribution of min mu in standard deviation sigma,

27
00:01:15,025 --> 00:01:16,385
the formula is this,

28
00:01:16,385 --> 00:01:18,840
where mu is the very center of the curve,

29
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,105
and sigma is related to its width.

30
00:01:21,105 --> 00:01:22,799
So if sigma is large,

31
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,329
then the curve is very wide,

32
00:01:24,329 --> 00:01:25,370
and if sigma is small,

33
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:27,240
then the curve is very narrow.

34
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:28,439
So in order to define gamma,

35
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:31,694
we just use one divided by two sigma squared.

36
00:01:31,694 --> 00:01:33,159
Notice that if gamma is large,

37
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:34,200
then sigma is small,

38
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,880
so the curve is narrow, and vice versa.

39
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:40,049
If gamma is small, then sigma is large and the curve is wide.

40
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:41,759
In the higher dimensional case,

41
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,905
this formula becomes a little more complicated.

42
00:01:43,905 --> 00:01:46,590
But as long as we think of gamma as some parameter that is

43
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,135
associated with the width of the curve in an inverse way,

44
00:01:50,135 --> 00:01:55,000
then we are grasping the concept of the gamma parameter and the RBF kernel.
