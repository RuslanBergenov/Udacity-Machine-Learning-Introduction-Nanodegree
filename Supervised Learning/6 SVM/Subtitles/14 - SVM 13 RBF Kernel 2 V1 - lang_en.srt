1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,948
Now, let's see how the kernel method works in higher dimensions.

2
00:00:03,948 --> 00:00:06,404
Here, we still want to draw a mountain at every point.

3
00:00:06,405 --> 00:00:11,535
In the 3D case, this mountain is a Gaussian paraboloid and it lifts the points like this.

4
00:00:11,535 --> 00:00:13,995
Then if you want to separate the point from the rest,

5
00:00:13,994 --> 00:00:16,019
we can cut it with a plane.

6
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:18,179
The plane will intersect the paraboloid at

7
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:21,750
a circle and this circle is what will become our boundary.

8
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:24,240
So if we have more points, we'd do the same.

9
00:00:24,239 --> 00:00:28,229
We use a similar method than before to find the right weights for the combination of

10
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,940
mountains that will bring the majority of

11
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:33,300
the red points up while keeping the majority of the blue points down.

12
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:35,404
And then we cut this with the plane.

13
00:00:35,405 --> 00:00:36,762
When we project down,

14
00:00:36,762 --> 00:00:38,820
then the intersections of the curve on the plane will

15
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,030
give us the boundaries that will split our data.
