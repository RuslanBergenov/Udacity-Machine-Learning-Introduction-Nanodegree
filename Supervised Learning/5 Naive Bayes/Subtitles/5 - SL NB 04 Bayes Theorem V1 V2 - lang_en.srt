1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,790
So, let's look at a formal version of Bayes Theorem.

2
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:04,935
Initially, we start with an event,

3
00:00:04,934 --> 00:00:06,959
and this event could be A or B.

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:09,414
The probabilities for each are here,

5
00:00:09,414 --> 00:00:12,029
P of A, and P of B.

6
00:00:12,029 --> 00:00:14,339
Now, we observe a third event,

7
00:00:14,339 --> 00:00:20,129
and that event can either happen or not happen both for A and for

8
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:26,804
B. R is going to help us find more exact probabilities for A and B in the following way.

9
00:00:26,804 --> 00:00:31,864
Let's say we can calculate the probability of R given A,

10
00:00:31,864 --> 00:00:37,479
and also, of R complement which is node R given A.

11
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:40,169
And similarly for R given B,

12
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:42,270
and R complement given B.

13
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,645
Now, our set of scenarios are these four,

14
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:48,585
R n A, R complement n A,

15
00:00:48,585 --> 00:00:52,064
R n B, and R complement n B.

16
00:00:52,064 --> 00:00:54,634
But since we know R occurred,

17
00:00:54,634 --> 00:00:57,929
then we know that the second and the fourth events are not possible.

18
00:00:57,929 --> 00:01:01,719
So, our new universe consists of the two events,

19
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:05,250
R n A and R n B.

20
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:10,454
We calculate the probability for A n R or equivalently A intersection R,

21
00:01:10,454 --> 00:01:12,640
and by the Law of Conditional Probability,

22
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,885
this is P of A times B of R given A.

23
00:01:15,885 --> 00:01:20,280
Similarly, for B intersection R. Now,

24
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,219
since these probabilities do not add to one,

25
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:26,099
we just divide them both by their sum so

26
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:29,684
that the new normalized probabilities now do add to one.

27
00:01:29,685 --> 00:01:34,394
Thus, we get the following formulas for P of A given R,

28
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:37,920
and P of B given R. These are

29
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,530
our new and improved probabilities for A and B after we know that R occurred.

30
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:48,180
Again, P of A and P of B are called the prior probabilities which is,

31
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,970
what we knew before we knew that R occurred.

32
00:01:50,969 --> 00:01:53,849
P of A given R and P of B given R,

33
00:01:53,849 --> 00:01:56,309
are posterior probabilities which is,

34
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,775
what we inferred after we knew that R occurred.

35
00:01:59,775 --> 00:02:01,500
And here it is,

36
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,599
the formula for Bayes Theorem..
