1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,975
Yes, it's easy to think.

2
00:00:01,975 --> 00:00:06,244
Let's forget about the one that always lies and in real life maybe that's a good thing.

3
00:00:06,245 --> 00:00:09,900
But in here we could really get good information out of this one,

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:13,240
what if we ask this friend a lot of yes-no questions.

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,339
Well we'll always get the wrong answer so all we have to do is do the exact opposite.

6
00:00:18,339 --> 00:00:22,329
In this way, the complete liar gives us a lot of information.

7
00:00:22,329 --> 00:00:26,169
In contrast, the one who lies half of the time doesn't really help

8
00:00:26,170 --> 00:00:30,130
us much since we have no idea if we should believe them or not.

9
00:00:30,129 --> 00:00:32,994
Obviously a truthful one is super-helpful too.

10
00:00:32,994 --> 00:00:36,849
So we conclude that the worst one is this one in the middle.

11
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,350
In the same way, we'll have our three models.

12
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,545
Model one is the truthful one which is always correct,

13
00:00:42,545 --> 00:00:45,810
model two is a random one which is correct roughly half of the time,

14
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:49,000
and model three is a liar which is always wrong.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,804
So what we'll do is we'll assign the truthful model a large positive weight,

16
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:58,530
the random model a weight of zero since it's useless and the liar model

17
00:00:58,530 --> 00:01:03,630
a large negative weight since we'll do the exact opposite as this model says.

18
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,100
So here's a bit of math,

19
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:10,364
we have our number line and we want our weight function to look like this.

20
00:01:10,364 --> 00:01:13,459
Super positive for the truthful models,

21
00:01:13,459 --> 00:01:18,239
zero for the useless models and super negative for the liar models.

22
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:20,655
Let's remember how the models look,

23
00:01:20,655 --> 00:01:22,185
they look like this.

24
00:01:22,185 --> 00:01:26,670
Let's look at the accuracy the truthful model has accuracy around one,

25
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,879
the random model has accuracy around 50

26
00:01:28,879 --> 00:01:32,545
percent and the liar model has accurate around zero.

27
00:01:32,545 --> 00:01:35,125
So this function will help us check it out,

28
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:42,625
y equals natural logarithm of x divided by one over x where x is the accuracy.

29
00:01:42,625 --> 00:01:46,780
Check this out, it's very negative for values close to zero,

30
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:53,269
for 0.5 it's logarithm of 0.5 divided by 0.5 which is logarithm of one which is zero.

31
00:01:53,269 --> 00:01:56,519
Finally it's very positive for values close to one.

32
00:01:56,519 --> 00:01:59,530
There are actually much heavier mathematical reasons for this

33
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:02,560
to be the function but that's outside the scope of this course.

34
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,799
In the instructor comments we'll link some reading material including

35
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:09,814
their regional paper by Freud and Sapphire if you're curious.

36
00:02:09,814 --> 00:02:12,310
If your head is spinning and you're alarms are going off because you

37
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:14,715
saw potential division by zero don't worry,

38
00:02:14,715 --> 00:02:16,354
we'll deal with that in a bit.

39
00:02:16,354 --> 00:02:20,019
So we conclude that a great formula for weight is this,

40
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:24,060
natural logarithm of accuracy divided by one minus accuracy.

41
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,750
So a small quiz,

42
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:29,030
can you find the weights for these three models over here?

00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:31,129
