00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,334
Okay, so let's dive a bit deeper into the art of splitting data in two.

2
00:00:04,334 --> 00:00:06,404
Let's look at this dataset over here,

3
00:00:06,405 --> 00:00:08,070
and I'm going to draw it twice.

4
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:12,105
And now, I'm going to draw two lines that separate the blue and the red points.

5
00:00:12,105 --> 00:00:15,030
Here's one and here's another one.

6
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:19,634
And here's a quiz, which one do you think is the line that better separates the points,

7
00:00:19,635 --> 00:00:22,200
the line in the left or the line in the right?

8
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:24,129
Enter your answer below.
