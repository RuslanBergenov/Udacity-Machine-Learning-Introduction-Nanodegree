1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,556
So, let's recall what classification means.

2
00:00:02,556 --> 00:00:06,060
Classification means we have some blue points and some red points,

3
00:00:06,059 --> 00:00:09,279
and we want to find a boundary that separates them.

4
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:10,899
So now, we want a little more.

5
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:15,000
We actually want the boundary to be as far away from the points as possible.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,149
So, what we do is we add these other two boundaries

7
00:00:18,149 --> 00:00:21,649
that you can see as equidistant parallel lines to the main line,

8
00:00:21,649 --> 00:00:26,234
and we'll try to maximize the distance between these two or the margin,

9
00:00:26,234 --> 00:00:28,289
but this set is very nicely separable.

10
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:30,820
Let's look at one that is slightly more complicated.

11
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:32,865
Let's look at this set over here.

12
00:00:32,865 --> 00:00:35,160
So again, a normal classification algorithm

13
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:37,854
would just find a boundary that splits these points,

14
00:00:37,854 --> 00:00:39,554
but we want a bit more.

15
00:00:39,554 --> 00:00:43,344
We want a boundary with a margin as wide as possible.

16
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:46,649
So, let's think. There are two ways to measure this model.

17
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:49,004
One is by how many points it misclassifies,

18
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:52,109
and the other one is by how wide the margin is.

19
00:00:52,109 --> 00:00:54,015
So, what are the misclassified points?

20
00:00:54,015 --> 00:00:56,280
Well, there is this red point in the blue area,

21
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,590
and there is this blue point in the red area,

22
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:02,270
but we also want no points in this margin over here.

23
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:04,170
So, let's actually punish this points,

24
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,185
which means, we'll make them part of our classification error.

25
00:01:07,185 --> 00:01:11,055
So, the yellow circle show you exactly where the classification error is.

26
00:01:11,055 --> 00:01:12,925
And now, we have the margin error,

27
00:01:12,924 --> 00:01:14,204
so let's look at this margin.

28
00:01:14,204 --> 00:01:17,549
And basically, we want this margin to be as wide as possible.

29
00:01:17,549 --> 00:01:19,304
We want to include this in the error,

30
00:01:19,305 --> 00:01:20,935
and we'll see how to do this later.

31
00:01:20,935 --> 00:01:24,090
But in a nutshell, our new error for this algorithm

32
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:27,450
is going to be a classification error plus a margin error.

33
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:29,909
And minimizing this error is what's going to give us

34
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:32,420
the algorithm for support vector machine.
