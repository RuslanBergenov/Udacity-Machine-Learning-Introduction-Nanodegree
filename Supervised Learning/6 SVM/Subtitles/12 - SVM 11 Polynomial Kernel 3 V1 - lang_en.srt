1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,220
Well, that was not an easy quiz.

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:04,290
To show you the answer, what we're going to do is we're

3
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:06,705
going to calculate all these three equations,

4
00:00:06,705 --> 00:00:08,528
x plus y, x times y,

5
00:00:08,528 --> 00:00:10,080
and x squared plus y squared,

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,925
at each one of the eight points.

7
00:00:11,925 --> 00:00:13,575
So, here we have our eight points.

8
00:00:13,574 --> 00:00:15,750
Minus 3 minus 3, 3 minus 3,

9
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:17,609
etc., all the way to 1,1.

10
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:19,109
And the first four are red,

11
00:00:19,109 --> 00:00:20,669
and the last four are blue.

12
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,965
So, let's calculate x plus y.

13
00:00:22,964 --> 00:00:27,960
At the first point, minus 3 minus 3 is the sum of two coordinates, which is minus 6.

14
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,050
For the second one, it's 3 minus 3 which is 0,

15
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,079
and all the way to 1 plus 1, which is two.

16
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:37,299
And let's see what happens to these values in the number line.

17
00:00:37,299 --> 00:00:39,759
The blue points are mapped at 0, 2 and,

18
00:00:39,759 --> 00:00:43,839
minus 2, and the red points are mapped at 0,6 and minus 6.

19
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,620
There's still no clear cut,

20
00:00:45,619 --> 00:00:47,769
no place where we can cut this number line that

21
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,545
will separate the red points from the blue points.

22
00:00:50,545 --> 00:00:54,579
And this is something we could have guessed before because x plus y is a linear equation,

23
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:56,259
and we've established in the previous video,

24
00:00:56,259 --> 00:00:59,034
that linear equations do not separate these points.

25
00:00:59,034 --> 00:01:01,839
And therefore, a line won't be able to cut these data.

26
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,370
So let's try with the next one,

27
00:01:03,369 --> 00:01:06,189
x times y, which is not linear, so, there is a hope.

28
00:01:06,189 --> 00:01:09,034
So x times y has the following values,

29
00:01:09,034 --> 00:01:10,979
minus 3 times minus 3 is nine,

30
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,907
3 times minus 3 is minus 9, etc., etc.,

31
00:01:13,906 --> 00:01:17,048
all the way to 1 times 1 equals 1.

32
00:01:17,048 --> 00:01:19,159
And we plot these points on the line,

33
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:21,274
and the blue points go to 1 and minus 1,

34
00:01:21,275 --> 00:01:25,265
and the red points go at 9 and minus 9 so there is still no separation.

35
00:01:25,265 --> 00:01:27,549
There's no way to cut this number line in two,

36
00:01:27,549 --> 00:01:30,200
in such a way that the red points are on one side,

37
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,195
and the blue points are on the other side.

38
00:01:32,194 --> 00:01:34,594
So, xy won't work either.

39
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,549
Now, let's try with x squared plus y squared.

40
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:39,709
At minus 3 minus 3,

41
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:43,378
we get minus 3 squared plus minus 3 squared, which is 18,

42
00:01:43,378 --> 00:01:46,204
and all the other values are 18,18,18,

43
00:01:46,204 --> 00:01:47,629
and then two for the blue ones,

44
00:01:47,629 --> 00:01:50,494
since 1 squared plus 1 squared is equal to two.

45
00:01:50,495 --> 00:01:51,898
So, in our number line,

46
00:01:51,897 --> 00:01:53,950
all the blue points cluster at two,

47
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,344
and the red points cluster at 18.

48
00:01:56,344 --> 00:01:58,280
And now, we can cut the number line in two,

49
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,710
because if we draw a vertical line at 10.

50
00:02:00,709 --> 00:02:02,569
It can really be anywhere,

51
00:02:02,569 --> 00:02:04,834
but the best cut is at the middle, which is 10.

52
00:02:04,834 --> 00:02:07,114
Then we've managed to separate the points.

53
00:02:07,114 --> 00:02:10,264
So x squared plus y squared is the function that wins.

54
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:13,414
And so, basically, what we have is that for the blue points,

55
00:02:13,414 --> 00:02:15,747
x squared plus y squared equals two,

56
00:02:15,747 --> 00:02:19,377
and for the red points, x squared plus y squared equals 18.

57
00:02:19,377 --> 00:02:21,541
And how do you split it at two and 18?

58
00:02:21,542 --> 00:02:23,765
Well, let's say with the 10 that goes right in the middle.

59
00:02:23,764 --> 00:02:27,500
So, our magic equation is x squared plus y squared equals 10,

60
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,923
and let's remember that equation.

61
00:02:29,923 --> 00:02:31,152
Now, we go to the circle.

62
00:02:31,152 --> 00:02:33,739
And what do you think the equation of this circle is?

63
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:36,305
Well, x squared plus y squared is equal to 10.

64
00:02:36,305 --> 00:02:40,099
That is the circle that separates the red points from the blue points.

65
00:02:40,099 --> 00:02:42,139
But now, let's go back to the building methods,

66
00:02:42,139 --> 00:02:45,529
since I promised that the circle method and the building method were the same.

67
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,405
So, here, I'll show you why.

68
00:02:47,405 --> 00:02:49,444
Let's recall that on the left,

69
00:02:49,444 --> 00:02:51,560
we have a flat world, and on the right,

70
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,060
we have a three-dimensional world,

71
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:55,409
which is a building with many floors.

72
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:57,728
And our new axis is z.

73
00:02:57,728 --> 00:02:59,768
And our floors are at z equals 18,

74
00:02:59,768 --> 00:03:03,525
the 18th floor and at z equals to the second floor.

75
00:03:03,525 --> 00:03:05,340
And the blue points are in the second floor,

76
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,365
and the red points are in the 18th floor.

77
00:03:07,365 --> 00:03:08,775
So, how do we separate them?

78
00:03:08,775 --> 00:03:12,194
Well, by putting a separator plane in the middle, say in the 10th floor.

79
00:03:12,194 --> 00:03:14,984
And that's what the SVM does in three-dimensions.

80
00:03:14,985 --> 00:03:19,980
It drafts the best separating plane with the algorithm that we've learned previously.

81
00:03:19,979 --> 00:03:23,087
But now, how do we get a circle out of this?

82
00:03:23,087 --> 00:03:25,514
Well, if we consider the function z equals x squared,

83
00:03:25,514 --> 00:03:28,069
plus y squared, that's this paraboloid.

84
00:03:28,069 --> 00:03:32,094
And this paraboloid intersects each one of the planes at a circle.

85
00:03:32,094 --> 00:03:34,734
The circle in the bottom contains the four blue points,

86
00:03:34,735 --> 00:03:37,180
and the one in the top contains the four red points.

87
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:39,730
And the circle in the middle plane actually goes here,

88
00:03:39,729 --> 00:03:41,379
and it has equation, you guessed it,

89
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:43,555
x squared plus y squared equals 10,

90
00:03:43,555 --> 00:03:46,680
since both of these values are z.

91
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,525
So, that's why the circle and the building method are the same,

92
00:03:49,525 --> 00:03:53,004
and they're both the kernel method for SVMs.

93
00:03:53,004 --> 00:03:55,569
So, here's a summary of what's happening.

94
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,699
Let's say we're in a two-dimensional world,

95
00:03:57,699 --> 00:04:01,389
and let's say we have a set of points that cannot be separated linearly.

96
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:06,069
So, we embed our dataset into a five dimensional world by taking the point xy,

97
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:12,280
and sending it to the point x comma y comma x squared comma xy comma y squared.

98
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:17,589
As a small example, the point 2,3 will be sent to the point 2, 3,4, 6, 9.

99
00:04:17,589 --> 00:04:19,779
Now, the data lives in higher dimensions,

100
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:21,219
and maybe we're lucky that in here,

101
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,505
we can actually separate it with a four-dimensional hyperplane.

102
00:04:24,504 --> 00:04:26,469
Well, now, we go back and project that to

103
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:29,530
the two-dimensional world and we get a polynomial of degree two,

104
00:04:29,529 --> 00:04:31,599
which will nicely separate our data.

105
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,670
This is called a polynomial kernel.

106
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:37,670
And a kernel really means a set of functions that will come to help us out.

107
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:40,545
So, to show this is a similar dataset twice.

108
00:04:40,545 --> 00:04:42,060
And if we use a linear kernel,

109
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,290
that's like a bag with tools,

110
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,913
and our tools are the variable x and variable y.

111
00:04:46,913 --> 00:04:49,139
And we're looking at all the functions that we can build

112
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:52,754
this linear combinations of these two variables so we can create, for example,

113
00:04:52,754 --> 00:04:55,290
2x minus y equals 1,

114
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:59,480
or 5x minus 2y equals three,

115
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,530
or x plus y equals 4.

116
00:05:01,529 --> 00:05:06,044
Basically any line. But, if we extend it to a polynomial kernel,

117
00:05:06,045 --> 00:05:07,770
now we have the following tools.,

118
00:05:07,769 --> 00:05:10,549
We still have x and y but now,

119
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,009
we also have x squared,

120
00:05:12,009 --> 00:05:13,704
xy, and y squared.

121
00:05:13,704 --> 00:05:18,019
This gives us a lot more room to build functions to separate the data.

122
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:21,829
So now we can construct circles such as x squared plus y squared equals

123
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:25,834
one or hyperbolas such as x times y equals one.

124
00:05:25,834 --> 00:05:29,250
And here, I only drew half of the hyperbola, but that's okay.

125
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,464
We can construct parabolas like this one at y equals x squared,

126
00:05:32,464 --> 00:05:36,709
and in general, we can create a lot more functions and build a lot more boundaries.

127
00:05:36,709 --> 00:05:39,639
And the algorithm is exactly as before.

128
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,689
We just add some dimensions to the data,

129
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:43,870
find a higher dimensional surface,

130
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:46,639
project it down, and we get our curves.

131
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:49,779
And if we have even higher degree polynomials like these, well,

132
00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:52,769
we can create them with a polynomial kernel of a higher degree,

133
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:56,437
say three, which has all these degree three monomials as well.

134
00:05:56,437 --> 00:05:58,829
And, in general, the degree of a polynomial kernel is

135
00:05:58,829 --> 00:06:03,310
a hyperparameter that we can train to find the best possible model.
