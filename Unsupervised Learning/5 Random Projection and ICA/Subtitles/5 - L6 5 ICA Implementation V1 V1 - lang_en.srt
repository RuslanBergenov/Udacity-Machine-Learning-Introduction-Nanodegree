00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,495
To implement independent component analysis in Scikit-learn, we import FastICA.

2
00:00:06,495 --> 00:00:09,365
Our datasets can be a list,

3
00:00:09,365 --> 00:00:11,679
an array containing other arrays.

4
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:12,820
So, here signal one,

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:13,935
signal two, signal three,

6
00:00:13,935 --> 00:00:16,530
these were they can be wav files,

7
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:20,800
and we zip them into one dataset.

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,170
Then, we declare FastICA,

9
00:00:23,170 --> 00:00:24,755
and we give it the number of components,

10
00:00:24,754 --> 00:00:26,929
the original components that we want to retrieve.

11
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:29,054
Then, we tell it to fit,

12
00:00:29,054 --> 00:00:31,214
and then components would contain

13
00:00:31,214 --> 00:00:35,640
the independent components that's the algorithm was able to find.
