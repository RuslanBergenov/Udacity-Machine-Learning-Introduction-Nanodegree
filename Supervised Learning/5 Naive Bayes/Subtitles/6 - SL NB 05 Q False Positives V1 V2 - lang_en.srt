1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,879
Now, let's look at an interesting application of Bayes Theorem.

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,554
Let's say we're not feeling very well and we go to the doctor,

3
00:00:06,554 --> 00:00:09,844
the doctor says there's a terrible disease going on,

4
00:00:09,845 --> 00:00:11,669
I'll administer a test for you.

5
00:00:11,669 --> 00:00:16,094
Moreover, she says that the test has 99 percent accuracy.

6
00:00:16,094 --> 00:00:20,070
More specifically, she says that for every 100 patients that are sick,

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:25,115
the test correctly diagnosis 99 of them and for every 100 patients that are healthy,

8
00:00:25,114 --> 00:00:27,984
the test correctly diagnosis 99 of them.

9
00:00:27,984 --> 00:00:31,994
If we want to be tactical, these are actually called sensitivity and specificity.

10
00:00:31,995 --> 00:00:33,884
Then while we're waiting for our test,

11
00:00:33,884 --> 00:00:36,699
we researched the Internet and find that on average,

12
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,585
one of every 10,000 people suffers from the disease.

13
00:00:40,585 --> 00:00:42,929
The next day the doctor calls with terrible news.

14
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:45,784
She says that we have tested positive for the disease,

15
00:00:45,784 --> 00:00:47,259
so now we're panicking.

16
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:50,579
But before panicking, let's turn to math and actually

17
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,439
calculate what is the probability of being sick. So here's a quiz.

18
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:59,195
Given the two pieces of information that the test has 99 percent accuracy,

19
00:00:59,195 --> 00:01:02,549
and that one out of every 10,000 people have the disease,

20
00:01:02,549 --> 00:01:06,344
what do you think the probability is that we're sick?

21
00:01:06,344 --> 00:01:10,094
Is it from 0-20 percent, from 20-40,

22
00:01:10,094 --> 00:01:14,435
40-60, 60-80, or 80-100?

23
00:01:14,435 --> 00:01:17,070
Take your guess and enter it below.
