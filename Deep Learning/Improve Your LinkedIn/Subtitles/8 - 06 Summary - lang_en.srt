1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,760
I know how frustrating,

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:03,320
daunting, and in some cases,

3
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:05,520
demoralizing it is to have to go through

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:09,060
the whole process of creating an account and building the network.

5
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:11,325
It can be hard to put yourself out there.

6
00:00:11,325 --> 00:00:14,100
Like many of you, I didn't see the value in investing

7
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,195
so much time and energy into nurturing my LinkedIn account,

8
00:00:18,195 --> 00:00:20,170
but as I continued my job search,

9
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:23,070
I kept seeing how more and more potential employers

10
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,235
were asking for LinkedIn profile URLs.

11
00:00:26,235 --> 00:00:30,175
Several of my applications could have been submitted solely on LinkedIn,

12
00:00:30,175 --> 00:00:31,820
if I had wanted to do so,

13
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,625
yet still I resisted.

14
00:00:33,625 --> 00:00:35,700
Almost an entire year later,

15
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:39,420
I was still actively looking for a job and was just about to the end of

16
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:43,545
my sanity when I finally stumbled across this role with Udacity.

17
00:00:43,545 --> 00:00:47,965
I applied for this position and literally one day later received an email from

18
00:00:47,965 --> 00:00:53,000
LinkedIn advertising the exact same position. I'm not alone.

19
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,940
According to Udacity's research,

20
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,960
one in four people don't network at all.

21
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,240
I am convinced that had I worked on my LinkedIn account more often,

22
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,660
I would have found this job sooner than I did.

23
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,880
Here at Udacity, we even did some research and found that

24
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,920
85% of job openings are filled through networking.

25
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,420
Eighty five percent, with recruiters relying more heavily on LinkedIn,

26
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,100
and the ease of creating quality networks that can

27
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:22,515
provide so much opportunity for growth and change,

28
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:25,550
having a LinkedIn profile can significantly

29
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:28,540
impact your job search and help you find your dream job.

30
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:34,890
