00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,650
A well written ReadMe is one of the most
important parts of a good repository.

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:07,350
The reading is necessary for
others because it tells people

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:11,550
what the code is for, how to build an
installer code, and how to contribute.

4
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,140
To teach you how to write a good ReadMe,

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:15,790
I'm going to hand you
off to my friend Walter.

6
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:16,774
>> Hey!

7
00:00:16,774 --> 00:00:17,898
>> Hey.
Nice to see you.

8
00:00:17,898 --> 00:00:18,890
>> Well, sure thanks for having me.

9
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:19,860
>> Thanks for coming.

10
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,310
So I have some students who need
to learn how to write ReadMe.

11
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,420
>> Well, that's perfect because
I teach a course on just that.

12
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:27,450
It's less than an hour long.

13
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:28,440
And it will teach you everything

14
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:31,240
you know about writing documentation for
humans.

15
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:31,740
>> Thanks.

16
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:37,040
So you'll find a link to Walter's
lesson in the instructor notes.

17
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,640
When you're finished with it,
head back here and will continue.
