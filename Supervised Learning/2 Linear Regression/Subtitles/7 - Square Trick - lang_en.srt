1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
So here's another trick that will help us move a point closer to a line,

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:08,280
and it's very similar to the absolute trick but it has a little bit of extra gravy.

3
00:00:08,279 --> 00:00:09,739
It's based on this premise.

4
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:12,210
If we have a point that is close to a line,

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,109
then this distance is small and we want to move the line very little.

6
00:00:16,109 --> 00:00:18,329
But if the point is far from the line,

7
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:20,879
then want to move the line a lot more.

8
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:23,129
The absolute trick that we learned previously does

9
00:00:23,129 --> 00:00:25,214
not have this property because if we remember

10
00:00:25,214 --> 00:00:31,109
the absolute trick adds alpha to the y-intercept w_2 and p times alpha to the slope w_1.

11
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:34,380
This has nothing to do with how far the point is from the line,

12
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,969
since P is just a horizontal distance.

13
00:00:37,969 --> 00:00:41,064
So let's just add the vertical distance into this formula.

14
00:00:41,064 --> 00:00:44,734
Let's look at this vertical distance between the point and the line.

15
00:00:44,734 --> 00:00:48,630
The point over the line has coordinates say,( p,q').

16
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:52,400
This distance is then q minus q' because q' is

17
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,225
the value at the line and q is the value of the y coordinate at the point.

18
00:00:56,225 --> 00:00:58,035
So what we do here is very simple.

19
00:00:58,034 --> 00:01:01,199
We just take this q minus q' and multiply it into

20
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,570
what we're adding to both the y-intercept and to the slope.

21
00:01:04,569 --> 00:01:07,709
This will again make the line go up by a bit and rotate in

22
00:01:07,709 --> 00:01:12,174
this direction except that now if the point is far from or close to the line,

23
00:01:12,174 --> 00:01:13,739
the amount the line moves will be

24
00:01:13,739 --> 00:01:18,044
affected and here's our new equation with a factor of q minus q'.

25
00:01:18,045 --> 00:01:20,230
Notice that here we get something for free.

26
00:01:20,230 --> 00:01:23,575
If the point is underneath the line instead of over the line,

27
00:01:23,575 --> 00:01:27,930
then q minus q' is actually a negative value and if this is the case then we're

28
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:32,475
subtracting something from the slope thus rotating the line in this direction instead,

29
00:01:32,474 --> 00:01:33,849
still towards the point.

30
00:01:33,849 --> 00:01:36,599
So this trick also takes care of points that are under

31
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:40,189
the line and we don't have to have two rules like we had on the absolute trick.

32
00:01:40,189 --> 00:01:42,575
We just have one same rule for both.

33
00:01:42,575 --> 00:01:45,094
Again, let's clarify this with an example.

34
00:01:45,094 --> 00:01:46,480
In this example over here,

35
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,020
we have the point (5,15) and notice that

36
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:51,569
this distance is going to be two because the line goes

37
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:57,259
through the (5,13) as two times five plus three is 13.

38
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:58,734
Now to change things a bit,

39
00:01:58,734 --> 00:02:01,299
we'll use zero point 0.01 as the learning rate.

40
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:07,409
So the absolute trick would be adding 0.01 to the y-intercept and 0.05 to the slope.

41
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:09,525
But now as our neutral access,

42
00:02:09,525 --> 00:02:14,030
we multiply the two numbers two adding to the slope and the y-intercept by two;

43
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:20,569
which means we're adding 0.12 to the slope and 0.02 to the y-intercept.

44
00:02:20,569 --> 00:02:25,775
So the equation of our new line is y equals 2.1_x plus 3.02.

45
00:02:25,775 --> 00:02:29,530
Notice that that line is going to be closer to the point.

46
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:32,000
So that's it. That's the square trick.
