00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,285
So here's a question, what is better the mean absolute error or the mean squared error?

2
00:00:05,285 --> 00:00:07,280
Well, there's no real answer to this.

3
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,359
Both are used for a lot of different purposes,

4
00:00:09,359 --> 00:00:12,074
but here's one property that actually tells them apart.

5
00:00:12,074 --> 00:00:14,609
So here's a set of data and we're going to try to

6
00:00:14,609 --> 00:00:17,589
fit it by minimizing the mean absolute error.

7
00:00:17,589 --> 00:00:21,054
So let's say we have line A, line B,

8
00:00:21,054 --> 00:00:24,129
and line C. And the question is,

9
00:00:24,129 --> 00:00:27,789
which one of these lines gives us a smaller mean absolute error?

10
00:00:27,789 --> 00:00:29,890
Enter your answer below.
