1
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:09,060
The K in K-means relates to how many clusters you want to split your data into.

2
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:10,985
So in a case like this,

3
00:00:10,984 --> 00:00:14,074
three clusters looks like it probably works best.

4
00:00:14,074 --> 00:00:17,434
Alternatively, if we had this set of points,

5
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:19,579
three clusters doesn't seem right.

6
00:00:19,579 --> 00:00:23,474
In this case, two clusters looks like it makes more sense.

7
00:00:23,475 --> 00:00:27,350
When we have lots of data in a large number of dimensions,

8
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:30,195
how do we decide how many centers to choose?

9
00:00:30,195 --> 00:00:35,484
Choosing K in practice is often a mix of art and science.

10
00:00:35,484 --> 00:00:38,600
Sometimes, researchers are interested in choosing

11
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,030
a specific K value based on preconceived ideas about a topic.

12
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:46,355
One example of this happens right here at Eudacity,

13
00:00:46,354 --> 00:00:50,084
we believe that students generally fall into one of three categories;

14
00:00:50,085 --> 00:00:51,980
students who are new to a field,

15
00:00:51,979 --> 00:00:54,669
students who are interested in scaling up their careers,

16
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,960
or students who are changing careers.

17
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,640
So, it makes sense to use K-means with K equal to three to see if our data

18
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:07,254
supports this idea of three types of students or three clusters of students.

19
00:01:07,254 --> 00:01:09,949
Sometimes, we don't have an idea of

20
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:13,210
how many clusters there should be before we collect data.

21
00:01:13,209 --> 00:01:16,094
For these cases, we'll look at another method

22
00:01:16,094 --> 00:01:19,640
that can be used to find the number of clusters in a dataset
