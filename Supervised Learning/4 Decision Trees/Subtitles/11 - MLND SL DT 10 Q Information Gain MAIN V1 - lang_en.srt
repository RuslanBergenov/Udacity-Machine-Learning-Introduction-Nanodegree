00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,399
Okay, so now, we'll use what we know about

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,995
entropy and information gain to build Decision Trees.

3
00:00:04,995 --> 00:00:06,690
Let's say, we have our data in the form of

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:09,929
these red and blue points and we want to split it into two.

5
00:00:09,929 --> 00:00:12,244
So, I'll show you three ways of splitting it,

6
00:00:12,244 --> 00:00:14,564
and here are the three ways.

7
00:00:14,564 --> 00:00:17,640
Now, let's have a small quiz: In which of

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,730
these do you think we have gained more information about

9
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:27,530
our data and in which one did we gain less information? Enter your answers below.
