00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:09,190
In the 1950s, computer scientists were

2
00:00:09,189 --> 00:00:12,250
coming to the realization that it might be best if they

3
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,980
didn't hard-code every decision a computer would

4
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:19,245
make as essentially never ending if-else statements,

5
00:00:19,245 --> 00:00:22,000
rather computer should determine what was

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,914
best by looking at data and recognizing patterns.

7
00:00:25,914 --> 00:00:28,390
This idea of recognizing patterns and

8
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:32,210
data is what is commonly recognized as machine learning.

9
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:34,695
Drawing from the world of statistics,

10
00:00:34,695 --> 00:00:37,590
in order to avoid hard-coding rules,

11
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,685
these new techniques involved rules that were based on distributions.

12
00:00:41,685 --> 00:00:45,719
But using statistical distributions as generators of data,

13
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:48,990
exposed pretty large discrepancies between the data

14
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:53,565
generated by our models and the data you actually obtained in the real rep.

15
00:00:53,564 --> 00:00:59,474
Machine learning has continued to evolve into extremely flexible models based

16
00:00:59,475 --> 00:01:05,314
more and more on data and less and less on human-enforced if-else statements.

17
00:01:05,314 --> 00:01:08,480
These flexible models have been shown to predict better

18
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,750
than previous well-defined modeling techniques.

19
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:16,469
This leads to the current state of machine learning where prediction has become

20
00:01:16,469 --> 00:01:22,519
key often creating extremely flexible and complex models.

21
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:27,799
These complex models outperform models that follow if-else statements set up by

22
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:30,530
humans as well as those that follow

23
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:34,849
distributions that are known as well-known probability distributions.

24
00:01:34,849 --> 00:01:41,164
Unfortunately, these complex models often leave the why of a prediction unknown.

25
00:01:41,165 --> 00:01:44,970
Though, these techniques might be able to identify tumors better than

26
00:01:44,969 --> 00:01:48,969
doctors or play at a world-class level in the game of Go,

27
00:01:48,969 --> 00:01:52,135
the individuals creating these models can't

28
00:01:52,135 --> 00:01:56,270
always explain why they're making these decisions.
