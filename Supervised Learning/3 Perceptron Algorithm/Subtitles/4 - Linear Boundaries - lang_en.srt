1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,245
So, first let's add some math.

2
00:00:02,245 --> 00:00:07,020
We're going to label the horizontal axis corresponding to the test by the variable x1,

3
00:00:07,019 --> 00:00:11,329
and the vertical axis corresponding to the grades by the variable x2.

4
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:14,250
So this boundary line that separates the blue

5
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,504
and the red points is going to have a linear equation.

6
00:00:17,504 --> 00:00:22,820
The one drawn has equation 2x1+x2-18=0.

7
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:24,214
What does this mean?

8
00:00:24,214 --> 00:00:27,629
This means that our method for accepting or rejecting students

9
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:31,529
simply says the following: take this equation as our score,

10
00:00:31,530 --> 00:00:34,685
the score is 2xtest+grades-18.

11
00:00:34,685 --> 00:00:36,545
Now when the student comes in, we check their score.

12
00:00:36,545 --> 00:00:38,015
If their score is a positive number,

13
00:00:38,015 --> 00:00:39,899
then we accept the student and if the score is

14
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:42,710
a negative number then we reject the student.

15
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,460
This is called a prediction.

16
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,620
We can say by convention that if the score is 0,

17
00:00:46,619 --> 00:00:49,484
we'll accept a student although this won't matter much at the end.

18
00:00:49,484 --> 00:00:53,210
And that's it. That linear equation is our model.

19
00:00:53,210 --> 00:01:00,420
In the more general case, our boundary will be an equation of the following wx1+w2x2+b=0.

20
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,450
We'll abbreviate this equation in vector notation as wx+b=0,

21
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:09,835
where w is the vector w1w2 and x is the vector x1x2.

22
00:01:09,834 --> 00:01:13,364
And we simply take the product of the two vectors.

23
00:01:13,364 --> 00:01:15,405
We'll refer to x as the input,

24
00:01:15,405 --> 00:01:19,000
to w as the weights and b as the bias.

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,983
Now, for a student coordinates x1x2,

26
00:01:20,983 --> 00:01:26,189
we'll denote a label as Y and the label is what we're trying to predict.

27
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:27,810
So if the student gets accepted,

28
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:29,280
namely the point is blue,

29
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,090
then the label is Y+1.

30
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:33,338
And if the student gets rejected,

31
00:01:33,337 --> 00:01:36,809
namely the point is red and then the label is Y=0.

32
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,825
Thus, each point is in the form

33
00:01:39,825 --> 00:01:45,810
x1x2Y or Y is 1 for the blue points and 0 for the red points.

34
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:48,570
And finally, our prediction is going to be called Y-hat and it will

35
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:51,919
be what the algorithm predicts that the label will be.

36
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,614
In this case, Y-hat is one of the algorithm predicts that the student gets accepted,

37
00:01:56,614 --> 00:01:59,010
which means the point lies over the line.

38
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:03,210
And, Y-hat is 0 if the algorithm predicts that this didn't get rejected,

39
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:05,864
which means the point is under the line.

40
00:02:05,864 --> 00:02:11,507
In math terms, this means that the prediction Y-hat is 1 if wx+b

41
00:02:11,508 --> 00:02:17,469
is greater than or equal to zero and 0 if wx+b is less than 0.

42
00:02:17,469 --> 00:02:20,099
So, to summarize, the points above the line have

43
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:24,810
Y hat=1 and the points below the line have Y-hat=0.

44
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:30,314
And, the blue points have Y=1 and the red points have Y=0.

45
00:02:30,314 --> 00:02:35,609
And, the goal of the algorithm is to have Y-hat resembling Y as closely as possible,

46
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:39,000
which is exactly equivalent to finding the boundary line that keeps

47
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,009
most of the blue points above it and most of the red points below it.
