00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,137
So a quick recap. We have two models,

2
00:00:02,137 --> 00:00:05,009
the bad one on the left and the good one on the right.

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:07,559
And the way to tell they're bad or good is to calculate

4
00:00:07,559 --> 00:00:11,730
the probability of each point being the color it is according to the model.

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:14,759
Multiply these probabilities in order to obtain the probability of

6
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:17,309
the whole arrangement and then check that the model on

7
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:20,960
the right gives us a much higher probability than the model on the left.

8
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,315
Now all we need to do is to maximize this probability.

9
00:00:25,315 --> 00:00:29,690
But probability is a product of numbers and products are hard.

10
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:32,820
Maybe this product of four numbers doesn't look so scary.

11
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:35,642
But what if we have thousands of datapoints?

12
00:00:35,642 --> 00:00:38,914
That would correspond to a product of thousands of numbers,

13
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:41,594
all of them between zero and one.

14
00:00:41,594 --> 00:00:43,655
This product would be very tiny,

15
00:00:43,655 --> 00:00:50,545
something like 0.0000 something and we definitely want to stay away from those numbers.

16
00:00:50,545 --> 00:00:55,298
Also, if I have a product of thousands of numbers and I change one of them,

17
00:00:55,298 --> 00:00:57,630
the product will change drastically.

18
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:02,642
In summary, we really want to stay away from products.

19
00:01:02,642 --> 00:01:04,500
And what's better than products?

20
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:07,265
Well, let's ask our friend here.

21
00:01:07,265 --> 00:01:11,805
Products are bad, but sums are good. Let's do sums.

22
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:14,885
So let's try to turn these products into sums.

23
00:01:14,885 --> 00:01:19,939
We need to find a function that will help us turn products into sums.

24
00:01:19,938 --> 00:01:21,779
What would this function be?

25
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,534
It sounds like it's time for a quiz.

26
00:01:23,534 --> 00:01:26,745
Quiz. Which function will help us out here?

27
00:01:26,745 --> 00:01:31,765
Sine, cosine, logarithm or the exponential function?

28
00:01:31,765 --> 00:01:33,450
Enter your answer below.
