1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,189
In this project you will apply

2
00:00:02,189 --> 00:00:03,780
supervised learning techniques and

3
00:00:03,779 --> 00:00:07,309
an analytical mind on data collected for the US census,

4
00:00:07,309 --> 00:00:09,660
to help a fictitious charity organization called

5
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,085
Charity ML identify people most likely to donate to their course.

6
00:00:14,085 --> 00:00:18,355
You will first explore the census data and learn how it is recorded.

7
00:00:18,355 --> 00:00:21,399
Next, you will apply a series of transformations and

8
00:00:21,399 --> 00:00:25,669
preprocessing techniques to manipulate the data into a workable format.

9
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:28,740
You will then evaluate several supervised learners of

10
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:33,109
your choice on the data and consider which is best suited for the solution.

11
00:00:33,109 --> 00:00:35,740
Afterwards, you will optimize them all you've

12
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:39,395
selected and present it as your solution to charity ML.

13
00:00:39,395 --> 00:00:43,990
Finally, you will explore the chosen model and its predictions under the hood,

14
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:47,815
to see how well it is performing when considering the data its been giving.

15
00:00:47,814 --> 00:00:49,759
I look forward to seeing your work.
