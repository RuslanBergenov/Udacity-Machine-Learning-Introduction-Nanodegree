1
00:00:04,820 --> 00:00:09,660
To see how the k-means algorithm works, consider this dataset.

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,870
On the x-axis, is the distance I travel on any given day,

3
00:00:13,869 --> 00:00:17,355
and on the y-axis is how awesome the place I went was.

4
00:00:17,355 --> 00:00:22,300
This cluster of points that are all the same distance are when I go to work.

5
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,350
Some days, I get to build awesome content,

6
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,050
which is fun, so these points represent those days.

7
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:33,670
Other days, I see students struggling with content and that bums me out,

8
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,950
so those days aren't as much fun.

9
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:38,440
My parents live pretty far away,

10
00:00:38,439 --> 00:00:40,679
which is represented by this distance.

11
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:42,530
I really like getting to see them,

12
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:46,064
so this cluster here represents the times when I get to see them.

13
00:00:46,064 --> 00:00:48,304
You can see that overall,

14
00:00:48,304 --> 00:00:50,270
being at my parents is pretty awesome,

15
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:52,020
but it doesn't happen very often.

16
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,400
The clustering of these groups is what k-means does when it looks at data.

17
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,274
In the k-means algorithm,

18
00:00:58,274 --> 00:01:02,424
we group the points closest to one another together into k groups.

19
00:01:02,424 --> 00:01:05,254
Here, k might be two clusters.

20
00:01:05,254 --> 00:01:10,859
One, to represent traveling to work and a second to represent visiting family.
