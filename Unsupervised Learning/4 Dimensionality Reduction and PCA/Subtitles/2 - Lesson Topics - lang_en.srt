1
00:00:01,790 --> 00:00:07,450
The math behind principal components is largely based

2
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:12,140
on linear algebra and can be pretty confusing the first time you see it.

3
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,540
In this lesson, you'll see how PCA works

4
00:00:14,539 --> 00:00:19,629
conceptually and I'll also show you how it works in code using scikit-learn.

5
00:00:19,629 --> 00:00:23,710
People's knowledge of PCA is similar to people's knowledge in cars.

6
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,800
Most people know how to drive and basically know how a car works,

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,820
but few people know how the engine,

8
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,399
or the brake system work.

9
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:33,939
The goal of this lesson is to get you to the level of

10
00:00:33,939 --> 00:00:36,969
mastery with PCA of an everyday user.

11
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:39,869
We'll teach you an overview of how PCA works,

12
00:00:39,869 --> 00:00:42,399
how to use PCA within scikit-learn,

13
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,405
and how to interpret the results.

14
00:00:44,405 --> 00:00:47,149
If you're interested in learning what's happening under the hood,

15
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:52,030
we provided additional links to learn PCA more in-depth.
