1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,149
So we had a question we're trying to answer and the question is,

2
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:05,218
how do we find this line that separates

3
00:00:05,219 --> 00:00:08,980
the blue points from the red points in the best possible way?

4
00:00:08,980 --> 00:00:11,330
Let's answer this question by first looking at

5
00:00:11,330 --> 00:00:14,663
a small example with three blue points and three red points.

6
00:00:14,663 --> 00:00:17,000
And we're going to describe an algorithm that will find

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,972
the line that splits these points properly.

8
00:00:19,972 --> 00:00:21,980
So the computer doesn't know where to start.

9
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:26,250
It might as well start at a random place by picking a random linear equation.

10
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,960
This equation will define a line and

11
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,609
a positive and negative area given in blue and red respectively.

12
00:00:31,609 --> 00:00:35,130
What we're going to do is to look at how badly this line

13
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,399
is doing and then move it around to try to get better and better.

14
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:40,450
Now the question is,

15
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:43,310
how do we find how badly this line is doing?

16
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,624
So let's ask all the points.

17
00:00:45,624 --> 00:00:49,344
Here we have four points that are correctly classified.

18
00:00:49,344 --> 00:00:56,000
They are these two blue points in the blue area and these two red points in the red area.

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,390
And these points are correctly classified,

20
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:01,200
so they say, "I'm good."

21
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,409
And then we have these two points that are incorrectly classified.

22
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:09,079
That's this red point in the blue area and this blue point in the red area.

23
00:01:09,078 --> 00:01:12,048
We want to get as much information from them so we want them

24
00:01:12,049 --> 00:01:15,754
to tell us something so that we can improve this line.

25
00:01:15,754 --> 00:01:18,625
So what is it that they can tell us?

26
00:01:18,625 --> 00:01:20,500
So here we have a misclassified point,

27
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:22,560
this red point in the blue area.

28
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,808
Now think about this.

29
00:01:23,808 --> 00:01:25,239
If you were this point,

30
00:01:25,239 --> 00:01:27,609
what would you tell the line to do?

31
00:01:27,608 --> 00:01:31,084
Would you like it to come closer to you or farther from you?

32
00:01:31,084 --> 00:01:32,964
That's our quiz.

33
00:01:32,965 --> 00:01:37,000
Will the misclassified point want the line to come closer to it or farther from it?
