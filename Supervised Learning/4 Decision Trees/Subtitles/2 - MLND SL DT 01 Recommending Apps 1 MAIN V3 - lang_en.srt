1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,975
So, let's start with an example.

2
00:00:01,975 --> 00:00:03,400
Let's say we're in charge of writing

3
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:07,570
the recommendation engine for the App Store or for Google play.

4
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:11,544
Our task is to recommend to people the app they're most likely to download,

5
00:00:11,544 --> 00:00:13,870
and we should do this based on previous data.

6
00:00:13,869 --> 00:00:17,195
Our previous data is this table with six people each in a row,

7
00:00:17,195 --> 00:00:20,060
and the columns are their gender, male or female,

8
00:00:20,059 --> 00:00:22,554
their occupation, work or study,

9
00:00:22,554 --> 00:00:24,070
and the app they downloaded.

10
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:28,094
The options for the app are Pokemon Go, WhatsApp, and Snapchat.

11
00:00:28,094 --> 00:00:32,325
So, the model we'll create will take the first two columns and guess the third one.

12
00:00:32,325 --> 00:00:37,105
So let's start with some small quizzes to test our intuition with this data.

13
00:00:37,104 --> 00:00:40,704
The first quiz is the following: if we have a woman who works at an office,

14
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:42,725
what app should we recommend to her,

15
00:00:42,725 --> 00:00:46,530
Pokemon Go, WhatsApp, or Snapchat?

16
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:49,914
The second quiz is the following: if we have a man who works at a factory,

17
00:00:49,914 --> 00:00:52,064
what app should we recommend to him?

18
00:00:52,064 --> 00:00:53,649
And the third one says, if we have a girl

19
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:55,795
who's in high school, what app do we recommend to her?

20
00:00:55,795 --> 00:00:57,270
