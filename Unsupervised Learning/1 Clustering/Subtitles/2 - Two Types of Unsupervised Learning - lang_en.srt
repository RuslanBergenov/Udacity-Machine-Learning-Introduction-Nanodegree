1
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,380
Take a look at these points here.

2
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:09,750
You can see that even without labels,

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:12,500
there are ways that we might group these points together.

4
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,484
In this particular plot,

5
00:00:14,484 --> 00:00:16,730
it appears that there are two groups.

6
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,969
Now, look at this set of points here.

7
00:00:19,969 --> 00:00:25,184
Here, it appears that the points in this plot can be grouped into three groups.

8
00:00:25,184 --> 00:00:28,500
If we were to add a new point say here,

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,969
we could easily say that it is similar to the rest of these points.

10
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:37,250
Similarly, if we were to add a point say here,

11
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,719
we could see that it belongs to this group.

12
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:43,950
Grouping data together in this way is known as clustering.

13
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,135
This is the first type of unsupervised machine learning that we'll look at.

14
00:00:48,134 --> 00:00:50,349
Take a look at these points here,

15
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:52,450
notice how they follow a pattern.

16
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,640
Another type of unsupervised learning,

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,734
we can use patterns in our points to reduce the dimensionality.

18
00:00:58,734 --> 00:01:00,115
So in this case,

19
00:01:00,115 --> 00:01:03,090
we could reduce from two dimensions to one.

20
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:08,215
This is a second type of unsupervised learning called dimensionality reduction.

21
00:01:08,215 --> 00:01:11,260
Throughout this course, you will get some practice with

22
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:15,390
each of these two types of unsupervised learning.
