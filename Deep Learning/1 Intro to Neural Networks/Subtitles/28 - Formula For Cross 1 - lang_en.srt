1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,310
So this cross entropy, it looks like kind of a big deal.

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:05,879
Cross entropy really says the following.

3
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:09,105
If I have a bunch of events and a bunch of probabilities,

4
00:00:09,105 --> 00:00:13,350
how likely is it that those events happen based on the probabilities?

5
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:14,759
If it's very likely,

6
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,684
then we have a small cross entropy.

7
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:21,299
If it's unlikely, then we have a large cross entropy. Let's elaborate.
