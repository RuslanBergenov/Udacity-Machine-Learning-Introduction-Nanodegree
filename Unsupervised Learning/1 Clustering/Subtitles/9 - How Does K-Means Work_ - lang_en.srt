00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:08,655
You now have seen in the main ideas associated and working with k-means.

2
00:00:08,654 --> 00:00:12,389
From understanding clustering as an unsupervised approach,

3
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:14,690
to choosing the appropriate number of clusters.

4
00:00:14,689 --> 00:00:17,640
But how do we actually build an algorithm that

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,425
figures out where the cluster centers are for these clusters?

6
00:00:21,425 --> 00:00:24,275
Let's take a closer look at how this works.

7
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:26,570
Let's use this plot as an example,

8
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,304
and go step-by-step through how the k-means algorithm works.

9
00:00:30,304 --> 00:00:31,739
When we start out,

10
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:35,234
we just have clusters of points with no groupings.

11
00:00:35,234 --> 00:00:39,629
We start k-means by randomly placing k points onto our plot,

12
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:43,020
where k is the number of clusters you want to end up with.

13
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:46,210
We call each of these k points a centroid.

14
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:49,049
They're just randomly placed amongst the data,

15
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:50,644
so we need to move them.

16
00:00:50,645 --> 00:00:55,835
The way we do this is to assign each point in our dataset to the closest centroid.

17
00:00:55,835 --> 00:00:59,299
Now that we know which points belong in each group,

18
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:01,924
we move the centroid to the center of these points.

19
00:01:01,924 --> 00:01:04,189
Once the centroid has moved,

20
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:07,609
points may be closer to the centroid of a different group.

21
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:12,500
Now, we will calculate the distance from each point to each centroid,

22
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:15,819
and again assign each point to the closest centroid.

23
00:01:15,819 --> 00:01:18,125
With this new assignment of points,

24
00:01:18,125 --> 00:01:20,379
we will again want to move the centroids to

25
00:01:20,379 --> 00:01:22,984
the middle of the group of the points assigned to it.

26
00:01:22,984 --> 00:01:27,379
This process will continue until the centroids no longer move.

27
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:29,039
This ends our search.

28
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,840
Here we have these k groups of clusters as our final results.
