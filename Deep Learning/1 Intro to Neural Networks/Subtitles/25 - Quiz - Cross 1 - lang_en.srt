1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,980
Well we're getting somewhere now.

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:05,099
We've concluded that the probability is important.

3
00:00:05,099 --> 00:00:08,969
And that the better model will give us a better probability.

4
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:10,544
Now the question is,

5
00:00:10,544 --> 00:00:13,109
how we maximize the probability.

6
00:00:13,109 --> 00:00:16,559
Also, if remember correctly we're talking about an error function and how

7
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:20,829
minimizing this error function will take us to the best possible solution.

8
00:00:20,829 --> 00:00:23,070
Could these two things be connected?

9
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:26,362
Could we obtain an error function from the probability?

10
00:00:26,362 --> 00:00:29,750
Could it be that maximizing the probability is equivalent

11
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:34,000
to minimizing the error function? Maybe.
