00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,500
Nice job completing this lesson on PCA.

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:10,079
This is not an easy topic to grasp,

3
00:00:10,079 --> 00:00:12,464
so congratulations on making it this far.

4
00:00:12,464 --> 00:00:14,535
A ton was covered in this lesson.

5
00:00:14,535 --> 00:00:17,629
So I provided a text recap on the next page for you.

6
00:00:17,629 --> 00:00:19,224
In the final lesson,

7
00:00:19,225 --> 00:00:24,340
you'll be learning about Independent Component Analysis or ICA from Jay.

8
00:00:24,339 --> 00:00:28,454
This is another unsupervised learning technique similar to PCA.

9
00:00:28,454 --> 00:00:33,265
He will be showing you a cool implementation of the technique involving a piano,

10
00:00:33,265 --> 00:00:36,039
a cello, and a television.
